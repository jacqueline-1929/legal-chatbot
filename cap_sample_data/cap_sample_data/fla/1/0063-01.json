        "text": "Baltzell, Justice:\nThe right of recovery of Gartman, the plaintiff, in the Court below, depends upon the legal effect and construction of an instrument of writing, in these words :\nTERRITORY 03? FLORIDA, > Walton County. \\\nKnow all men by these presents, that I, Joab Horn, of the Territory and county aforesaid, being in sound mind and perfect memory, are mindful this day to make a distribution of my property to my different children, to wit: David Gartman ; that for the natural love and affection which I bear towards him, and my deceased daughter, Drucilla, and the heirs of her body. In the presence of witnesses, do this day bequeath, covenant, and positively deed, a certain portion of my property, to wit: .a negro man, named Will, and wife Milly, and seven cows and calves ; to which species of property, I, the said Joab Horn, have at this time in possession, and owner of, clear of any enthrallment; and is to remain undivided, and in my possession, so long as I live \u2014 and after my death, immediately the stipulated properly in this deed composed, to be bona fide the property of David Gartman, with its increase, to have and to hold for-ever and forever.\nIn witness whereunto I have set my hand and seal, this 29th of June, 1829.\n1iis\nJOAB X HORN, [seal] marie.\nAnd in the presents of,\nJeeemiah Saveli.,\nReuben N. Baeeow,\nRichaed J. Compton.\nAppellants, the executors of Horn, contend that this instrument confers no right:\n1st. Because there was no delivery of the property, nor a sufficient delivery in law, of the deed.\n2d. Because a remainder is created after a life estate, which is not permitted by law, except in cases of trust, and by will.\n3d. Because the instrument is testamentary, and was revoked by the will of Joab Horn, made afterwards.\nA delivery of the property was not made \u2014 indeed, was inconsistent with the terms of the instrument. The inquiry then arises, does a deed dispense with delivery, and is it sufficient to convey the property, without a transfer of the possession. The law, in this respect, seems to be well settled \u2014 it being held, \u201c that in order to transfer property by gift, there must be either a deed, or instrument of gift, or there must be an actual delivery of the thing to the donee.\u201d 2 Barn. & Ald. 552. Adams vs. Hays, 2 Iredell, R. 366. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 438. 2 John, 52. 2 Leigh, 340. 2 Black, 441.\nIf valid as a deed, a second objection is, that there was no delivery of it. The instructions asked by defendant, shew that the deed was \u201c presented by the plaintiff, to the recording officer, for registration,\u201d and was recorded. Consequently, it- must have been in plaintiff\u2019s possession. This is sufficient evidence of delivery. Gilbert vs. Dunns lessee, 14 Peters, 322.\nNor does the fact of its being produced at the trial, by the defendants, under notice, alter the case. Brown vs. Winthrop, 1 John. Chy. 329\u2014256. Ingraham vs. Porter, 4 McCord, 198. Dawson vs. Dawson, Rice\u2019s Eq. R. 257.\nThe next point is, that a remainder in personal property cannot be created after a life estate, according to law.\n\u201c By the ancient common law, personal estate was little regarded, \u201c and thought to be subject to no modifications or limitations what- \u201c ever. A gift or grant of a personal thing, for a day, or even for \u201c an hour, was supposed to be equivalent to a gift, or grant of it \u201cforever.\u201d Shep. Touch. 116. \u201cButin succeeding ages, when \u201c commerce and civilization had given additional importance to per- \u201c sonal estate, new rules were introduced, to make it answer better \u201c the exigencies of society; and it was at length placed, with respect \u201c to the limitations of which it was susceptible, more upon an equality \u201c with real estate. In England, the only difference is, that real es- \u201c tate may be entailed, and personal cannot; and in this country, \u201c where estates tail are abolished, the rule is exactly the same with \u201c respect to real and personal estate.\u201d This was the case of a gift of slaves, to take effect after the death of grantor and wife, reserving a life estate \u2014 presenting the very point at issue in this case. Boyle Ch. Just. in Banks vs. Marksbury, 3 Littell R. 276.\nIn Smith vs. Bell, although it was the case of a will, yet the remarks of Chief Justice Marshall are pertinent to the present case. \u201c The rule that a remainder may be limited, after a life estate in \u201c personal property, is as well settled as any other principle of our \u201c law. The attempt to create such limitation is not opposed by the \u201c policy' of the law, or any of its rules.\u201d 6 Peters R. 78.\nIn North Carolina, the modern rule was first adopted. 1 Haywood, 234. 1 Murphy, 466. Afterwards the old common law rule was declared to be in force, the Judges expressing their regret in the cases decided by them, \u201c that a disposition of property, so just and simple in itself, could not be sustained.\u201d Foscue vs. Foscue, 3 Hawks R. 544.\n\u201cI think it a hard case,\u201d says Judge Hall, \u201c that this species of property cannot be conveyed, in a mode apparently so simple, when the reason upon which the rule was originally founded, is no more; and cannot but regret, that decisions upon the subject had not been more comformable to the nature of this kind of property, and the convenience of those who possessed it. Graham vs. Graham, 2 Hawks, 322.\nIn 1823, the Legislature altered the law as thus declared.\nIn S. Carolina, the Chancellor, in a case affirmed by the Court of Appeals, in 1839, says: \u201c I shall not, after the decisions which have been made in this State, trouble myself by inquiring, whether a personal vested interest, to be enjoyed in future, can be directly conveyed by deed, either as to realty or personalty ; that is a settled question.\u201d Dawson vs. Dawson, Rice\u2019s Eq. R. 261.\nIn Carnes and wife vs. Marley, the deed was: \u201c I give to H. Jones, to hold to him, and his executors forever; provided, that I resume the possession, use and labor of said slaves, for and during my natural life.\u201d The cause was before the Court of Appeals of Tennessee, in 1827, when the Court decided the gift invalid. The opinion, however, was not satisfactory, and a re-argument was granted. The case was again argued in 1830, and held under advisement until August, 1831. The Court then say: \u2018\u2018Nothing is better settled than that, an interest in remainder, after an interest for life expires, may be limited in a deed for slaves. 2 Yerger,.584.\nBut it is needless to multiply cases, when authority is so abundant, and the question has been so ably decided. 2 Kent Com. 352. Johnson vs. Mitchell, 1 Humphrey, 173. 2 Black, 398. 7 Harris & Johnson, 257\u2014272. 1 Henry Black, 535. 1 Murphy, 466.\nThe case of Thompson vs. Thompson, &c., has been cited as asserting a contrary doctrine. That was the case of an instrument not under seal, so that the point was not before the Court for decision. 2 How. Miss. R. 737.\nThe case in 12 New Hamp. R. is also relied on by appellants. It was the case of a deed not delivered to grantees, and in which the party claiming the benefit of it, conceded that it could not avail him as a deed. The question before the Court seemed to be rather as to the effect of subsequent arrangements between the parties, in revoking the deed. 12 New Hamp. 872.\nWe are of opinion then, that a remainder may be created in personal property, after a life estate, by deed.\nThe third position is, that the instrument is testamentary in its character \u2014 a question of some novelty in our Courts, and of no little difficulty.\nIf Mr. Horn intended the instrument of 29th June, 1829, to operate as a deed, and it is not legally impossible that it shall so operate, his intention should prevail. \u201c It is a benign principle, well established,\u201d says Chancellor Johnson, in a case confirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals of South Carolina, \u201c that if a paper, wearing the \u201c form of a deed, cannot operate as a deed, it shall, (if that will not \u201c prevent its provisions,) be allowed as a testament.\u201d Dawson vs. Dawson, Rice\u2019s Eq. R. 260. 4 Dessausure, 617.\nSo in Williams on Executors: \u201c It is settled law, that if the paper contains a disposition of property, to be made after death, though meant as a deed of gift or bond, and not intended as a will, yet, if it cannot operate in the latter, it may nevertheless, in the former character.\u201d 1 Williams ex\u2019rs, 55. 2 Haggard, 247.\n\u201c If the instrument is to be consummated only by death, and not .operate during life ; especially if it is not upon a stamp \u2014 contains no valuable consideration \u2014 is not delivered out' of the custody of the maker, and comprises no beneficial dispositions, but such as are ulterior to the death of the donor; in short, if death is the event which is to give life and operation to the instrument, the Court will grant probate of it as a will.\u201d Lovelass on Wills, 317.\n\u201c In respect to personal property, where there is a final intention proved and execution prevented by the act of God, the mere want of execution does not invalidate the instrument. The disposition intended to be made, has the same legal effect in regard to personal property as if the instrrments had been actually signed and attested. It is also settled law, and several cases have been decided, that if the paper contains the disposition of the property to be made after death, though it were meant to operate as a settlement or a deed of gift, or a bond, though such paper were not intended to he a will, nor other testamentary instrument, hut an instrument of a different shape, yet, if it cannot operate in the latter, it may nevertheless operate in the former character.\u201d 2 Haggard, 108-235.\nThese authorties are quoted without reference to the effect of our statute on the subject of Wills, which it is not necessary here to notice.\nThe question then is, can this paper' be sustained, and operate as a good and valid deed ? The rules for the transfer of real estate have long since been established, and their meaning, force and effect declared and well understood. We are not aware that any such exist, or have been prescribed as to personal property. Undoubtedly less form is required to transfer personalty; such property ordinarily is passed by mere delivery. The most that the authorities seem to require, is, that there be an actual gift \u2014 a design consummated \u2014 not the mere intention to give. In the case in 2 Yerger above cited, the words used were \u201c I give,\u201d and the deed was held sufficient; In the case of Dawson vs. Dawson, the deed was in these terms, \u201c this day I Richard Dawson, do give to my named children in my will, all my real estate, and all my personal property, and goods and chattels to my named children in my will, and I do acknowledge this day, to be theirn, and no others than those named in my will, and the use therein menshened.\u201d This, also, was established as a valid deed, coupled with the will so as to make the instrument take effect in futuro.\nIn Grangive vs. Arden, the holder of a lottery ticket wrote the name of his daughter on it and put it in his desk, afterwards said \u201c the ticket was hersit did not belong to him, he had given it to his daughter, &c.\n\u201c These declarations, say the Court, recognize a gift as having been made. They afforded reasonable ground for a jury to infer that all the formality necessary to a valid gift had been complied with.\u201d 10 John, 296.\nIn the case of Johnson vs. Mitchell the words were, \u201c I agree to throw into the hands of my sons-in-law.\u201d The Court say, \u201c that these words however unusual and inartificial, want the force and efficacy of the words, give or transfer, &c., it would be difficult to maintain,\u201d &c. 1 Humph. 173.\n\u201cIn the construction of deeds the Court will lean towards giving validity to a deed. If it will not have an operation one way, it may operate in some other way.\u201d Chase, Justice, 1 Harris &; John, 527.\ni( There is one general-principle that runs through the construction of deeds, that they are to be'construed most beneficially for the party to whom they are made ; and 2ndly, that a deed shall never be void, when the words may be applied to any intent to make it good.\u201d 1 Plow. 159.\nIt is true, that the instrument under consideration has some of the terms peculiar to wills, \u201c being in sound mind and body, are mindful this day to make distribution, do bequeath;\u201d yet the remainder of it has terms and provisions not contained in a will, but peculiar to a deed, showing an evident purpose to convey, a design executed, something done, in fact a deed. It does not commence as a will, but in the form of a bill of sale, \u201c know, all men by these presents;\u201d it contains a consideration. The words, \u201c do this day covenant,\u201d import agreement, bargain and obligation; \u201c positively deed,\u201d a certainty of transfer, a determination and purpose evidenced by use of a word in common acceptation, the most solemn and effectual, that is known among men. The reservation of a life estate especially would be absurd in a Will. It is entitled as a \u201c deed of gift to David Gartman\u201d by the person who drew it, and the probate by Compton, one of the witnesses, before Jeremiah Saveli a Justice of the Peace, who is also a witness and a defendant in the case, states, \u201c that the within deed was fairly assigned and delivered in his presents.\u201d\nIt is a striking feature of this case, that the object in construing this instrument a testament, is to effect its destruction, whereas the benign principle of construing deeds, &c., as wills, was designed for their preservation. If the instrument were defective as a deed, the argument might be more effectual under the authorities to sustain it as a will.\nIt has been insisted in this Court, that the deed was invalid, for want of a consideration, Gartman being only the son-in-law of Horn. This point was not presented in the Court below, from any thing appearing in the record ; and after a verdict we should be inclined to regard the case of plaintiff as made out except as to the objections raised by the bill of exceptions. The position however is not sustained by the authorities. Voluntary agreements in favor of strangers are sustained, and \u201c with respect to chattel interests, an agreement under seal imports a consideration at law.\u201d 3 Burrow, 670. 7 T. R. 350. Beard vs. Mitchell, 1 Vern, 42. 3 P. Wms. 222. Brown vs. Winthrop, 1 John ch. 336. 4 Com. Dig. 266, Fait B. 4 b.\nDelivery of this slave to Gartman would have been good by way of gift, and if a deed supplies the place of, and is a substitute for delivery, there would seem to be no objection to the want of a consideration.\nOne of the errors assigned is that the deposition of Jeremiah Saveli one of the defendants and executor of the will of Joab Horn, was offered in evidence, but rejected by the Court. The deposition is not a part of the record, nor does the bill of exceptions state what was designed to be proved by it, or the ground on which it was rejected. Under these circumstances, we cannot say whether the decision was right or wrong. We cannot take it for granted that the objection was because he was executor. It may have been that his testimony was not materia], and this is in accordance with the ground invariably acted upon by Appellate Courts, that every fair intendment is to be made in support of the judgment below. The office of a- bill of exceptions is to give the facts on which the Courts decided, and it should give all the facts bearing upon the decision, so that the Appellate Court, may know fully and clearly every thing which influenced the decision of the Court, After a statement of these facts it may then be stated, that the Court instructed the jury, or decided in such manner upon the facts so stated.\nUpon the whole case, we are of opinion that there is no error in the instructions given in the Court below, and that the judgment be affirmed.\nThe original deed produced in this Court will be delivered to ap-pellee\u2019s attorney, to be filed in the Court below.",

Pleas, general issue, and statute of limitations.\nOn the trial, plaintiff gave in evidence an instrument, purporting to be a deed of gift to him, from Joab Horn \u2014 the father of Eli Horn, one of the defendants \u2014 and on which his claim is founded. This instrument, or deed of gift, was, on the trial, produced by the defendants, under a notice from plaintiff, of which the following is a copy :\nTerritory of Florida, > Walton County. $ Know all men by these presents, that I, Joab Horn, of the Territory and county aforesaid, being in sound mind and perfect memory, are mindful this day to make a distribution of my property to my different children, to wit: David Gartman; that for the natural love and affection which I bear towards him, and my deceased daughter, Drucilla, and the heirs of her body. In the presence of witnesses, do this day bequeath, covenant, and positively deed, a ce.rtain portion of my property, to wit; a negro man, Will and wife Milly, and seven cows and calves; to which species of property, I, the said Joab Horn, have at this time in possession, and owner of, clear of any enthrallments; and is to remain undivided, and In my possession, so long as I live \u2014 and after my death, immediately, the stipulated property in this deed composed, to be bona fide the property of David Gartman, with its increase, to have and to hold forever and forever.\nIn witness where\u00fcnto I have set my hand and seal. ,\nhis\nJOAB !*!

RAMSAY, Clerk.\nThe plaintiff also offered in evidence the deposition of Jeremiah Saveli, one of the Executors of Joab Horn, and also one of the defendants ; which, being objected to by defendants, was ruled out by the Court.\nThe defendants gave in evidence the will of Joab Horn, deceased, executed subsequently to the deed under which plaintiff claimed, and revoking that deed; of which the following is a copy of so much thereof as is material:\n\u201cIn the name of God, amen: I, Joab Horn, formerly of the State of Georgia, but at present of Walton county, in the Territory of Florida, being of sound mind, but weak and infirm of person, sensible that it is appointed for all men to die, do make, ordain and publish, this, my last will and testament: First, for the purpose of leaving no part of my wishes in doubt, and trusting that none of my descendants will hare the impiety to attempt to disturb the disposition which I am now about to make of my wordly goods, I will state, that in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine, I made a certain disposition of my effects among my children, with the intention that the same should go into effect after my decease. This disposition of my effects, it has since become my design to alter in some particulars ; and it has been supposed that some of my descendants would resist any alteration in the same. Now, it is my express will, that should any one of those, to whom I heretofore expressed my intention to give any part of my property, attempt to thwart or prevent the accomplishment of this my last will, or any part of it, then such person shall forfeit all right to any and every portion of my estate heretofore, or hereby given, and the portion thereof destined to such person, shall return to the common stock of my estate, and be sold for the benefit of such of my heirs as shall not have attempted to thwart or prevent the accomplishment of my wishes, herein expressed. [The second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth articles, relate to the disposition of his pror perty to his different children.] Ninth: I appoint my son Eli Horn, Richard J. Compton and Jeremiah Saveli, executors of this my last will and testament, hereby revoking all former wills by me made.

X BAGETH.\nmark\nThe will was admitted to Probate, and recorded on the 17th day of August, 1840.\nThe counsel for defendants requested the Court to instruct the jury, that the instrument of writing, purporting to be a deed of gift, was invalid. '\nFirst: Because there was no delivery of the property therein mentioned, nor a sufficient delivery in law of the said deed ; inasmuch as, although it was presented by the plaintiff to the recording officer for registration, yet it was produced on the trial by the defendants, under a notice from plaintiff; from which fact, the counsel for defendants insisted that the jury should presume it was in the possession, custody, and control of the said Joab Horn at his death, and was found among his papers by his executors, to wit: these defendants.\nSecondly: Because said deed is invalid in its nature, in thus creating a-fee simple, after a life estate in personal property; the Court ruling, that this instrument did not convey an estate remainder in personalty, after a life estate, but a present interest.\nThird: That said deed is testamentary in its character, and is revoked by the said will. '\u25a0\nWhich instructions the Court refused; -whereupon defendants excepted.\nThe counsel for defendants also requested the Court to instruct the jury, that even if this instrument, purporting to be a deed, was valid as a deed, then this action is barred by the statute of limitations ; which the Court reftsed, there being no evidence of an adverse possession until 1840, and this suit having been commenced jn 1841.\nCarmack & Woodward, for Appellants :\nThe decision of this case depends upon the question, whether the instrument of writing, (purporting to be a deed of gift,) is a deed conveying a present interest at its date, or a will to take effect upon the death of Joab Horn who executed it. This instrument was found in the possession of the Sonor at his death, and was produced on the trial by the executors, the present appellants, under notice from the appel-' lee. If if be regarded as a deed conveying a present interest on its face, it is void for want of delivery. 4 American Com. Law, 235. No. 2, ib. 237, No. 9. 1 Iredell\u2019s Dig. 175. Sec. 17 ib. 181. Sec. 60.\nBut suppose for argument sake, that it was duly delivered\u00bb and in possession of the donee, it is then void as a deed because it is a gift, and by its terms the possession of the property is not to be delivered until the death of the grantor. A gift is incomplete and void until the possession of the thing given is delivered. 2 Blackr stone\u2019s Com. 441. 2 Kentj 438. Hovenden on frauds, 421, 422.\n1 Eq. Dig. 397. As a gift therefore it was not binding on the grantor, at any time during his life. And if not binding might at any time be revoked; and if revocable and not binding, this instrument, regarded as a deed, conveys nothing, and is therefore void.\nIf this instrument conveys no interest in the property, because the possession was not delivered, nor to be delivered until the death of the grantor, it cart at the most be regarded only as a contract, or rather a \u2022promise to give at a future time. Now viewing it either -as a contract or a promise to give, it is void for want of consideration; a nudum factum, out of which' no action can arise. Natural love and affection, is a good consideration to support a gift made and perfected by delivery of the thing given. But it is no consideration to support a.promise or contract to give. To make the present instrument therefore binding as a promise or contract to give, it should have been upon a valuable consideration. There is no pretence of any such here, and without it, this instrument is void as a contract or promise to give ; Noble vs. Smith, 2 John\u2019s rep. 52. Pearson vs. Pearson, 7 John\u2019s rep. 26. Cook vs. Hastard, 12 John\u2019s rep. 188. Grangiac vs. Arden, 10 John\u2019s rep. 293. Fink vs. Cox, 18 John\u2019s rep. 145. Hooper vs. Good, 1 Swan, 486. Cotteen vs. Missing, 1 Maddrep. 108.\nBut regarding this instrument as a deed of conveyance, and not merely as a contract or promise to give at a future time, it is void because there is neither a good nor valuable consideration to support it. The natural love and affection, which Joab Horn had for his deceased daughter and her children, is no consideration to support a gift to David Gartman, after the death of his wife, the donor\u2019s daughter. After her death, David Gartman does not stand toward the donor in the domestic relation, which makes natural love and affection a good consideration to support a gift to him. The natural love and affection which' the donor had for his deceased daughter and her children, cannot enure to David, to support a gift to him. Metcalf & Perkin\u2019s Dig. 99, sec. 33.

Roberts on Fraud, 453, note B.\nIt is- at least questionable, whether a remainder can be created by deed in a personal chattel, unless it be by conveyance in trust. If this deed can convey no remainder in the property attempted to be conveyed, it is void on that account. 8 Bacon\u2019s Ab.

Com. 874.\nIf any one of the above propositions can be sustained, it then follows that this instrument, regarded as a deed, is void;'and it is believed that all are maintainable. But if any additional authority is wanted, to show that, as a deed, it is void, this is abundantly shown from the fact, that the books show, \u201c that all instruments which are to operate after death,\u201d though intended at the time they were executed to be deeds, are wills; and it is immaterial what may be the form of the instrument, or whether made upon a good or valuable consideration. 12 New Hamp. 371. 2 Ves.

So did not think Joab Horn, when he made this instrument, as is proved from the face of it.\nThis instrument is not only more like a will than any of the deeds poll, above referred to, for they were in all things like deeds of conveyance, except in the time the gift was to take effect \u2014 in pos-| session of the .donor \u2014 viz: \u201c after the death of the grantor.\u201d But. this is upon its very face, more like a will than a deed. It is like a deed in nothing, except, \u201che positively deeds,\u201d arfd signs it with a-seal at the end of his name ; neither of which has much tendency to prove it to be a deed; as wills are often made with a seal, and generally are in the present tense, \u201c I give.\u201d 1st William\u2019s Executors, 55 \u2014 95.\nThe whole face of the instrument, with this exception, shows that it is a will, and was so intended.\nBjit if it is a will, it is revocable \u2014 if revocable it has been revoked by a subsequent will.\nWalker Anderson, for appellee, submitted the following :\nI. First exception \u2014 Want of delivery : \u2014 Delivery ofthe property in specie, was not necessary to the consummation of the gift or grant\u2014 because: \u2014 1. A present delivery was not consistent with the nature of the interest conveyed, which was a remainder after a life estate. And because: 2. The delivery proved was a sufficient delivery in law.\n1. \u201c Delivery must be according to the nature of the thing.\u201d 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 439.\n2. The fag; of the delivery to Gartman was for the jury to determine ; and mthis Court it is to be presumed the delivery to him was complete \u2014 (as was the fact.)\n\u201c A delivery to \u00e1 third person, as the servant or bailee of the grantee, will be valid.\u201d Soubervye & Wife vs. Arden, et. al. 1 J.

Law Dicty. 523. 8 B. & C. 67\u00cd.\n\u201c A formal delivery (of a deed) is not necessary, if there be acts evincing an intent to deliver.\u201d Goodrich vs. Walker, 1 J. C. 250.\nBut the exception does not seem so much to negative the original delivery, (that fact having been established by the jury,) as to intimate that the subsequent possession of the deed by the grantor, amounted to a revocation.\nThis position is opposed by numerous authorities, and is adverse to well established general principles. ' A gift, once consummated by actual or constructive delivery, cannot be recalled, without the consent of the grantee. . .* . . \u2019\n\u201c If a deed'has been once delivered, so as to take effect, a second delivery can be of no avail.\u201d V. vs. Sterny, 12. J. R. 536.\n\u201c If a deed be duly delivered in the first instance, the subsequent \u201c custody-of it by the grantor will not destroy-the effect of the delivery.\u201d 'Soubervye & Wife, vs. Arden et. al. \u00cd J. C. R. \u00bf56.\n\u201c Even non-delivery, unless accompanied by other circumstances, 4 will not avoid \u00e1 deed.\u201d : , \u2022\nIb. 257, quoting 2 Yern. 473, and 1 Atk. 625, in which Lord Hardwicke held, that a voluntary deed, formal as to-its execution, and without a power of revocation, and kept by the grantor, uncan-celled,' was not- to be defeated by a subsequent will.\nHe went even further, in the case of Johnson vs. Smith, (257,) in 1 Ves. 314.- . -\n44 A voluntary\u2019settlement, without power of revocation, cannot be revoked\u201d \u2014 ib. 258, referring to Villiers vs. Beaumont, 1 Yern. 100 ; and Bole Vs.

R. 329 \u2014 30\u201431\u201436\u201437.\nThe delivery of the- deed to Gartman having been shown to .be sufficient; and irrevocable, ft is scarcely necessary to adduce any authority to show, that a gift or grant- by deed, is equivalent to the actual.delivery of-the.chattel. This point was conced^ on the trial, and no longer admits of any . doubt. ' * - . ' ' \u2022\nJ refer the Court, however, to. a few authorities on this head.\n\u201c As, between the parties, a voluntary transfer, by deed, of a chat-14 tel interest, is valid, without any consideration appearing.\u201d Bunn vs. Winthrop,-1- J. C. R. 329 \u2014 330-^331\u2014336\u20147.'\nDelivery, though in general necessary to the validity of a gift, may be supplied by-deed-or writing. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 438. .

Bell, 6 Pe'ter\u2019s Rep. 78. * ,\nBlackst\u00f3ne is conclusive on this point, He says: \u201cBy the an- \u201c cient common l\u00e1w, there could be no future property, to take \u201c place in, expectancy, created in personal goods and chattels \u2014 but \u201c yet in last wills such limitations were permitted, though originally \u201cthat indulgence was only shown, when merely the use of the goods, and not the goods themselves, was given to the first legatee. \u201c But now that distinction is disregarded ; and therefore, if a man, \u201c either by will or deed, limits his books or furniture to A, for life, \u201cwith remainder over to B, this, remainder over is good.\u201d,, 2 Bl. Com. 398. - .1 v\nThe case before the Court is precisely such a one. J\u00f3\u00e1b Horn \u2022 conveys a remainder to Gartman, after a life estate' to himself; or it is more closely assimilated to the gift of the\u2018use, to a first legatee, with remainder over. \u2022 . \u2022 \u2022 \u2022-\n:In contradiction of all these authorities, a single case was relied on at bar, from McCord\u2019s Reports, whiqh I have not before me. I think its tenor was opposed to the creation of an estate in futuro, without an intervening\u2019 interest. It is obvious, I think,-that this case is not one of that kind \u2014 a present int\u00e9rest is -conveyed by the deed, which attached upon the\u2019 delivery of the deed, though its enjoyment was postponed to a future time. In the case Of Lightioot\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, vs. Colgin & wife, this . point is cle'arly established. At the 77th page, 5 Munford\u2019s Reports, Judge Roane, in expressing, his\u2018concurrence with the Court, speaking of a certain conveyance, which 'was the subject of controversy, says: \u201c Considered \u00e1s a grant, it is of no importance that' a remainder Only is granted,' while the life estate is retained. That remainder is a vested interest \u2014 is-a real advancement, and may. be alienated.\u201d \u25a0 \u2022\nOther parts of this case are good authority, on the subject of the retention of the property by the donor, not defeating a gift, to take effect in futuro. % ' . . ..\n, III. The third exception alledges, that the deed is testamentary in its character.\n>To this objection I oppose: 1. The evident intention' of the donor. And % The terms of the instrument itself. .\n1. Joab Horn did not reg\u2019ard it as a will, for otherwise he would not- have delivered it to Gartman,\u2019 to have had it recorded. He would not haye made- provision in -the instrument for the property remaining in his possession', if he had regarded it as a will, which could have no effect, till'after'his death. He speaks in the instrument o'f it, as \u201c litis deed\u201d \u2014 a term too familiar, even tO the unlearned, to have been applied by him .to a paper designed for \u00e1 will. And above all, he makes no disposition of the.residue of his property, nor mentions his other children, ant! appoints no executors. In short, there is nothing about the whole instrument to support the exception, but the single word bequeath,^ used in connection with the binding phrase, positively deed.\" This is a word, (bequeath,) not so familiar t\u00f3 the unlearned; and here it evidently conveys no meaning, adverse to the well understood word deed, 'used more than once. . \u2022\nThe whole structure pf the instrument \u2014 its singleness of character, (being confined-t\u00f3 a conveyance of a single piece of property, to a single individual,) with all its -incidents,'intrinsic and extrinsic, negative the idea-that Joab Horn designed it for a will. /\nBut I contehd that, whatever might be the intentions of Joab Horn, the terms of the instrument are'such as to control that intention. . ; >\n\u201c A deed is a writing, sealed and delivered by the, parties.\u201d \u2019 I Tom.

The only object of a deed is, to serve as an evidence of the gift ; and in some cases, /to answer in lieu of a present .delivery of the property. No greater formality is necessary in a gift by yriting, than in a'.verbal-gift; if the intention is manifest, that is all that is required. \u25a0\nBesides, \u201can uncertainty shall be taken in favor, of the grantee;\u201d Jackson on Dem. .

The fourth exception relies upon the statute; of limitations, as a bar to this action. ' ' , \u25a0\n\u2022 This statute was made to bar stale claims, and punish negligence. Joab Horn died in, \u00cd840: \u2014 who could have sited him for the negro mentioned in .this-deed, while living? Certainly not/David Gart-man, or any claiming under him. \u25a0 He Had no .right to the possession of the negfo till the old man\u2019s death,-and within a year after that occurred, suit was brought. \u25a0 \"\nThe cause of action accrued to David Gartman in 1840, and not sooner;.and the statute, as to him, began to run only from thattime. If he was barred by the statute, then would every remainder man be barred, when, the particular estate happened to be of longer duration than five years. * \" .\n, There must be an adverse possession too, to enable a person to bring an- action surtrover; and the statute \u25a0 commenced to run,only from the time when the adverse possession begun.-' Surely it will not be contended that the possession of Joab Horn, during his life, was adverse, o' . \u2022\n\u2022 I do not -deem it necessary to trouble the Court with any authority on this- obvious point, beyond the familiar one;' in 1 Tidd\u2019s Practice, at page 17.'

See 5 Peters\u2019- Sup. Co. Rep. 580..\nThe intention is to be collected from the paper itself, from the understanding of the parties; and taking the whole instrument together, if the clear design of the grantor appears to be, to \u201c deed\u201d the property, the. effect follows of consequence. \u25a0 \u2022 - ; 1\nIn 1st Massachusetts\u2019 Rep. 219, is a case where the Court gave effect to an instrument having no words of grant in the premises, and held sufficient to pass a -fee to land, from the words used.in other parts of the deed. The Court recognizing the great rule of law to h'e, to effectuate the intention of the parties at the time; \u201c if it can be done consistently with the rules of law.\u201d In that paper the term \u201c granted,\u201d occurred \u2014 \u201c granted premises,\u201d and a right \u201c to convey\u201d\u2014 and from these, the .Court concluded the\" intention and carried it into effect. Again, Patterson Justice, in delivering the opinion of the Circuit Court for the Pennsylvania District,'in 4 Dallas Reports 347, speaks to like effect, that to' effectuate the intention, is the great ruje of interpretation. Examining this paper then with a view to the intention of the parties, let us inquire 'what was the manifest intention of Joab Horn, when he signed and sealed it ? He .'declares1 himself \u201cmindful this day to make a distribution of his property,\u201d &c.; he does \u201c this day bequeath, covenant, and positively-deed\u201d property, He then has \u201cinpqssession.and owner of, clear of any enthralments.\u201d\nNow did not the party intend to give a present effect to his present purpose ? Does he not declare his ability at that hour to. make the distribution, while'he is clear of debt ?, Does he not exhibit a plain purpose to vest a present interest in this specific property 1 And he couples with the active power of the clause, which positively deeds the property to Gartman, the Peoviso, that it is to remain in the possession of the donor during life, and then with its increase to be the property of the donee in good faith,\nLet us test the question of present interest; and to that end let me ask, would not this conveyance to Gartman, have protected the property against the creditors of Horn, who might have become such, subsequent to the deed 1 Suppose afterwards that Horn had become involved, all the world having notice of this transfer, would not the estate vested in David Gartman have been protected from such subsequent creditors ? .There cannot be a doubt, because when Joab Horn was \u201cclear of any enthralments,\u201d he had that day made distribution by deed of gift among his children ? When he had no creditors, when he was clear of the world, he had distributed his estate as he had a right to do, and there remained in him, but the use of the property during the brief remnant of his days.\nThis point has been judicially determined by the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland in 1826, the case of Bohn vs. Headley. 7th Harris & Johnson, p. 257 to 272,.\n\u201c A deed of gift of -personal property from a father (who was not indebted at the time) to his child, executed, acknowledged and recorded, according to law; conveying the property to the child, with a PROVISION, that the donor was to remain in its possession and use , during life. Held to be valid both at common law and under the Statute of 13th Eliz. 1.\nAn examination of that case will show the Court, that all the objections here taken were insisted on, before the Court of Appeals of Maryland. It was contended the gift was void by the Statutes 13 and 27 Eliz., that it was void at common law; that the gift; was re-vocable on its face, and that by the subsequent sale of the negroes to a third person, the grantor did revoke it. Each of these points was met by the Court, and decided in favor of the grantee under the deed. The Court will note further, that the decision is placed not upon the Statute of Maryland, but upon the Statutes of England and the common law. The subsequent purchaser was there the plaintiff below, suing for the negroes; and the grantee held the negroes against the subsequent purchaser from the Grantor.\nAnother case from the'same Court, is yet nearer in analogy to the case at bar; and presents the distinct question, whether a donor can retain to himself the possession and use of the chattels for life, by the same deed of gift which passes the title to the property. In the case of Hope, Administrator of Hope vs. Hutchings, 9th Gill and Johnson 77; the defendants intestate executed and delivered to the plaintiff Thomas Hutchings, a bill of sale dated August 21, 1818, and for, and in consideration of the natural love and affection she bore to the grantee and his wife, (her- daughter,) and for the better maintainance, support and preferment of them, made the bill of sale of negroes, and all the household furniture of which she may be possessed at the time of her deceaseProvided, the said Hannah shall not be debarred or prevented, holding, using and enjoying the said property above as aforementioned, and all profits arising therefrom during her natural life.\u201d\nUpon the construction of the deed, the Court by Stephen Judge declared, \u201c that from the terms of \u201c the instrument itselfj the legal '\u25a0\u2018title upon its execution immediately passed to the grantee, and that \u201c nothing more than a mere usu-fructuary interest or right of enjoy- \u201c ment, was intended to be reserved by the grantor in relation either \u201c to principal or profits.\u201d\nSo in the case from 1 Murphey\u2019s law and equity, rep. 466, in North Carolina, it was decided in 1810; and in Caines & Wife vs. Marley, 2nd Yerger\u2019s Tennessee Reports p. 582, the deed of gift re] served the possession, use and labor of said slaves for and during the natural life of the donor, and after his death, the said grantee was to have the actual possession with the absolute title see also, 1 Humphrey\u2019s R. 171. Johnson us. Mitchell. And in each ofthese cases it will be seen that the principle is recognized of \u201c the power of the owner to dispose of the remainder of a chattel reserving to himself a life estate,\u201d as considered in the 31st year of George III, to he good law, evinced by the judgment of the Court, in 1 Henry Blackstone, p. 535, in the case of Doe vs. Polgrean. I consider that the Court below struck the right path, when they declared, that David Gartman by the deed took \u201c a present interest in the property,\u201d and the case from'Blackstone fully confirms it \u2014 that was the case of a present gift by deed vested possession in a certain event, and the case turned upon the point.\nIn Grantham vs. Hawley, Hobart 132, it was held that a grant of \u201c such corn as should be growing on the ground at the end of a termwas a good grant, and it mattered not that it was not in possession, no! nor in existence at the time of the grant.\nIt is not my purpose to enter upon the question of delivery of the deed \u2014 or the delivery of the property; nor to show the .authorities on this point. They are fully and ably presented by Mr. Walker Anderson in his brief. To a few additional cases, I will however call the attention of the Court, Comyn\u2019s Digest, p. 278, title a. 2 Dyer\u2019s Report, 167, B. 1 Croke 7, Shelton\u2019s case. Shepard\u2019s Touchstone 57. And' of modern date: 12.Pickering, 145. Banks m. Markesberry, 3 Litt, 275. Gardner vs. Collins, 3 Mason, 398. Caines & Wife vs. Marley, 2 Yerg 582. Pennington vs. Gittings, 2 Gill & Johns, 216.\nII. As to plaintiffs title upon defendants evidence.\nUpon the trial the executors offered in evidence, Joab Horn\u2019s last will and testament insisting that he had thereby revolted this disposition of his estate.\nIn order to give any effect to this will as a Revocation, the counsel insist that the paper under which we claim is a testamentary disposition \u2014 and how do they prove it ? By showing that even less formal papers than this, have been admitted to probate. I deny that this is any proof at all, and an examination of the cases cited, will show that the true principle is this, viz:\n0\u25a0 \u201cInstruments of writing when nugatory in the character intended, are often set up as wills by the parties in interest, and are admitted to probate in order to carry into effect, the maker\u2019s object which must other wise fail of accomplishment.\u201d\nIn 4th Eng. Eccle. rep. 108, Sir John Nickoll declares this general principle as settled law.-\nAlso see Rigden vs. Vallier, 2 Yesey Senior, 255, deed void for want of livery, set up as a will. See Masterman vs. Baberly, 4 Eng. Eccle. Rep. 108.\nThe case cited in the notes to 1 Williams on excutors, p. 65, note n. Bartholemy vs. Henry, 3 Philimore 318, and found in 1st English Eccle. Rep. 406, is the assertion of the-mere general expression that the Court- will give effect to dispositions of property to be consummated by death, although the deceased might not be aware that he performed a testamentary actand the text of Williams is in precise conformity with the principle coupled with this adjunct\u2014 that the Courts never give such effect to a paper on its face in different form, until it has failed to operate in that form. In 1 Jarman on Wills p. 13, note 1. \u201cA paper which purported to be a deed and was executed as such, but which was not to take effect until after the death of the grantor was construed as a will in order to give it effect. Millege vs. Lamar, 1 Dess 617.\n\u2022 So then the Court will thus see, that the question whether this might not be construed as a will, and given effect to as such, cannot well arise here, until the Court have come to the conclusion that it is ineffectual as a deed.\nIf ineffectual as a deed, we are out of Court. In another suit it may be contended that a paper may be testamentary in its character, and yet irrevocable by the Testator\u2019s last will, as Lord Hardwicke in Peacock vs. Monk, 1 Yesey, Sen. 127, seemed to consider possible. But \u201c sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.\u201d\nThe case from 12 New Hampshire, cited by Judge Carmack counsel for appellants, is full to show the correctness of my position. The grantee failing to uphold the paper as a deed, sought to have it admitted to probate as' a Will. The Court say there is no intrinsic difficulty in this ; but then the party was met by the revocation of it\u2014 by his own consent and relinquishment of all rights under it, by his receipt of property under the last will and testament in lieu- of this very grant.\nIn the case at bar, the party in interest does not seek to alter the face, nor to charge the name of the paper. The paper is a deed of slaves \u2014 we do not seek to set it up as a will-\nThe appellants seek to set up this paper as a will, only that they may change its character \u2014 they would style it a testament, that it may become revocable \u2014 they would admit it a will, only to, render it nugatory \u2014 they seek not to give it effect but to destroy. We rely upon the deed as it is, signed, sealed and delivered by the grantor in his life time. Recorded and declared to all the world as his act and deed, over which he no longer had power and dominion \u2014 which was and is irrevocable in its very nature.\nAs authorities are desired by the Court upon the question whether the paper A, is testamentary in its character, I will adduce them, with an argument to show their application.\nThe counsel for appellants, declared, \u201c the distinctive characteristic of a will to be its reference to the futurethis is not precise nor accurate.\nThe ambulatory character is its distinctive attribute \u2014 that is, the act itself is not fixed till death, nothing attaches \u201c in present\u00ed.\u201d Jar-man on Wills in his 1st vol. p. 11, well explains the distinction. He says, \u201c It is this ambulatory quality which forms the characteristic of wills, for though a disposition by deed may postpone the possession or enjoyment, or even the vesting until the death of the disposing party, yet the postponement is in such case produced by the express terms, and does not result from the nature of the instrument.\u201d\nAnd the author then gives an example, closely analagous to the case at bar. \u201c Thus, if a man by deed, limits lands to the use of 1\u2018 himself for life, with remainder to the use of A in fee, the effect \u201c upon the usu-fructuary enjoyment is precisely the same as if he should, by his will, make an immediate devise of such lands to A \u201c in fee \u2014 for in the former instance, A, immediately on the execution \u201c of the deed, becomes entitled to a remainder in fee, though it is \u201cnot to take effect in possession, until the decease of the settler, \u201c while in the latter \u2014 (the case of the will) \u2014 he would take no inter- \u201c est whatever, until the decease of the testator should have called \u201c the instrument into operation.\u201d\nNow apply .this reasoning to the case here.\nImmediately on the execution of the deed, David Gartman becomes entitled to a remainder in fee, though it is not to take effect in possession, until the decease of the grantor \u2014 -for the postponement is, in this case, produced by the express terms, and not from the nature of the instrument.\nAgain: \u201c A will as to personal property is considered as having existence only from the death of the testator, not from the time of its execution.\u201d\nCase of Elcock\u2019s Wills, 4 McCord, 39, cited in 1 Williams on Ex. ch. 2d, note 3.\nIn Audley\u2019s case, in 4 Leon, 166, it was considered conclusive against the construing an instrument as testamentary, that by it an estate was to be taken by the maker, \u201c who could not take by his own will.\u201d See 1 Jarman on Wills, p. 13, note e, Tompson vs. Browne, 2 Mylne & Keene, 32. 8 Cond. Eng. Chancery Rep. 262.\nNow, it is very true, that papers most inartificially drawn, have been admitted to probate \u2014 but for what causes, and on what grounds ? If its purpose be testamentary \u2014 if it is only to be consum. mated by death \u2014 if it is not to operate during life \u2014 if it comprises no beneficial dispositions \u2014 if no interest whatever is taken under it, but such as are ulterior to the death of the donor \u2014 in short, if death is the event which alone can infuse any life into the instrument, then it is considered as testamentary \u2014 then it is a will and testament. Love-lass on Wills, p. 317 \u2014 8. 1 Jarman on Wills, p. 11. Thorold vs. Thorold, 1 Phillim 1. Roberts on Wills, p. 59. 1 Williams on Executors, p. 53 \u2014 55. Shepard\u2019s Touchstone, 399.\nAnd it is settled law, that the will could not be valid, unless there is present the \u201c animus testandi. \u201d If there were no intention of making an operative will, the paper is no will. Shepard\u2019s Touchstone, 404. Nicholls vs. Nicholls, 2 Phil. 180. Taylor vs. D\u2019Egville, 3 Hagg, 206.\nO\u00edr He must do some act, declaring the instrument to be his will. Powell on Devises, 54. And it is clear that where the party intends to make, and does make a deed, he does not design a will.\nThis paper writing, then while it is perfectly sufficient as a deed, would be entirely inoperative, were it propounded as will \u2014 for it never could be admitted to probate.\nCarmack, in reply:\nI. It is no answer to the argument that this instrument is testamentary, to prove, from an elaborate examination of the books, that it is, in some respects, like a deed. Like a deed, it is under seal; but so occasionally are wills. The terms \u201c positively deeds,\u201d are used, which'is by no means very common in deeds, and can, therefore, have but little, if any tendency, to prove that it was even designed to be a deed. Indeed this extraordinary expression is, I mil venture to assert, as unusual in deeds as it is in wills. But it proves nothing in regard to the legal effect of the instrument, which is the question to be discussed \u2014 and but little in regard to the design\u2014 especially when it is connected with the word \u201c covenant,\u201d which is now used as a term of conveyance, and with the words'\u201cbequeath,\u201d st distribution of my property,\u201d which are very common in wills, and wore probably never used in a deed, unless this should be decided to be a deed.\nII. The certificate of Probate proves only what the witness and Justice of the Peace thought of this instrument. It had a seal, and they thought it a deed. But their opinions are not authority to prove any thing to the present purpose.\nIII. It is mistaking the question again, to apply the doctrine, that in construing an instrument of writing, the intention of the parties, if that can be ascertained, must govern; and when it cannot be ascertained, the writing shall be construed more strongly against the party making it. These are rules to ascertain the meaning of the instrument \u2014 to ascertain what the parties have said, by the instrument, that they would do, or had done. But what the parties designed the instrument to be, is another and very different question, which it is not at all useful to decide, nor need it be investigated, except as a matter of curiosity. For once the meaning of the instrument is ascertained, the law affixes its character, which the design of the party making it can no more control, than it can control any other stubborn rule of law.\nIt is not that the party thought he was making a deed, that makes it a deed. In every case, and we have shown them to be numerous, both in this country and in England, where a deed-pole or indenture, has been declared to be a will, the party who made it thought that he was making a deed; and if the rule contended for on the other side, could control the character of the instrument, they would have been deeds.\nIV. A disposition of property, \u201c to take effect after death,\u201d unless it be a present conveyance to a trustee, to save such limitation, has generally been held revocable, and therefore a will.\nThe only cases cited, which form exceptions to this rule, are those from Maryland and Tennessee. In one case in Maryland, the administrator was sued, and if the instrument was good, either as a will or a deed, it in either character conveyed title, and the question might not have been deemed material. In the othei', the question whether it was a will or deed, was not made, and it probably escaped the attention of the Court. In the first case decided in Tennessee, although the Court relies partly upon the common law, to sustain the instrument as a deed, yet that decision mainly rested upon the authority of one case in North Carolina, decided shortly after the revolutionary war, and a dictum of Judge Haywood, that that decision had become a rule of property, in both North Carolina and Tennessee. These decisions, standing alone, against the other American authorities and all the English, can be no authority here.\nNumerous cases from North Carolina have been cited, almost in point, showing that this writing is a will, and void as a deed. The case in New Hampshire is in point. The party there did not offer it as a deed \u2014 perhaps he was too modest \u2014 and it was decided not to be a will, only because it had been revoked. The case in Mississippi is in point also.\nV. It is not necessary that this instrument, or any other, should first be decided by the Court not to be a deed, as is contended on the other side, before it could be offered for probate as a will. This did not happen in any of the numerous cases already cited, and no objection appears to have been taken to their probate as wills, on that account.\nVI. It may be true, as a general rule, that instruments of this kind have been regarded as wills, because they could not operate as deeds, from a benevolent desire to give effect to them in some form or other; but I am not aware that it has ever before been argued, that such an instrument must, and ought to be a deed, lest, perchance, it might be ineffectual as a will. I cannot, therefore, see the supposed inconsistency of our argument, by which we prove this to be a will, because it happens to be our intention to have it destroyed by the subsequent will. This inconsistency which is contended for, can only be proved, by. first showing that this little instrument is a more worthy object of the benevolent attention of the Court, than the last will and testament of Joab Horn.\nVII. This deed had no present operation, at .the time it was made. Its declaration that the property mentioned in it was Joab Horn\u2019s, and that it was to remain his, and undivided, until his death, was the mere statement of a truism, which was just as true before it was stated in the deed, as it was afterwards. This cannot be called a present operation of the deed. If it may, every will has the same present operation. \u201c And then,\u201d (after the death of Joab,) \u201c to be bona fide the property of David Gartman!\u201d \u2014 the only part of the whole instrument which conveys the property to David. It was to remain Joab\u2019s property during ,his life, and to be David\u2019s at his death \u2014 precisely such an interest as a will would have created \u2014 with only this difference, that perhaps no paper, which was a will in form, ever so explicitly described just such an interest as the law allows to be given by will.\nVIII. It has not been shown that a delivery of the thing given, is not as necessary when the gift is by deed, as when by parol. A parol gift is as good as a gift by deed, if it can be as effectually proved. The deed may, in cases of a present gift, prove a delivery of the property, by way of estoppel \u2014 the donor being estopped, by his deed, from denying that every thing has been done necessary to make a present effectual gift. By this means the deed proves a delivery of the property. But there is nothing on the face of this instrument to estop the donor from denying the delivery; on the contrary, the deed itself proves that there was none, and that there was to be none until the death of the donor. It is then only a promise to give at a future time, and on that account void.\nIX. All the cases read, to prove that a remainder may be,created in personal property, are cases of wills or deeds of trust, except the cases from Maryland and Tennessee, if they may be regarded as exceptions. This we never denied. We merely deny that a remainder can be created in personal property, by deed, unless it be a deed of trust, and we have Story & Kent, to sustain us in this denial, besides the reason of the thing. By a conveyance in trust, the trustee becomes presently the legal owner; he can sue for, and recover the property, even from the cestui que trust. The relation of trustee and cestui que trust, is not known in a Court of law; it is only in a Court of Equity where it is recognized, and where contingent and future interests in personal property can be maintained and enforced."
