        "text": "Bamczell, Justice:\nTo an action instituted by the plaintiff as assignee of Francis, on a judgment recovered against defendants, suggesting a devastavit, they plead \u2014 1st, That they were not indebted. \u2014 2dly, No such record. \u2014 3dly, Reciting the bankrupt law of the United States as to the time of maintaining suits, &c. that the suit was not brought within two years after the decree of bankruptcy, and more than two years after the cause of action accrued. \u2014 \u20184th, That the suit was not brought within two years after the decree of bankruptcy, nor within two years after the cause of action accrued. \u2014 -5th, That the declaration and decree of bankruptcy was not made, nor. did the cause of suit accrue to plaintiff at any time within two years before his suit was brought. Plaintiff demurred to the 1st, 3d, 4th and 5th pleas, and took issue upon the second.\nThe court below adjudged the 1st, 4th, and 5th pleas to be sufficient, and overruled the 3d plea, declaring it to be insufficient. The issue on nul tiel record was tried, and found for plaintiff; but the other issues being with the defendants, the Court gave judgment in their favor. Plaintiff has assigned for error, the overruling the demurrer to the first, fourth, and fifth pleas, and giving judgment for defendants.\nWe are of opinion that the Court decided correctly as to the first plea. Nil debet as well as not guilty may be pleaded to an action suggesting a devastavit against executors. Williams on Executors, 1225. Coppin vs. Carter, 1 T. R. 402.\nThe sufficiency of the other pleas depends upon the proper construction of the 8th section of the act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States. This section provides, \u201c that the Circuit court in and for the District where the decree of bankruptcy is prayed, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the District Courts of all suits at law and equity, which may be brought by any assignee of the bankrupt, against any person or persons claiming an adverse interest, or by such person against such as-signee, touching any property or rights of property of said bankrupt, transferrable to, or vested in such assignee, and no suit at law or in equity shall in any case be maintainable by or against such assignee, or by or against any person claiming an adverse interest touching the property and rights of property aforesaid, in any court whatsoever, unless the same shall be brought within two years after the declaration and decree of bankruptcy, or after the cause of suit shall first have accrued.\u201d\nIt is contended by plaintiff that this cause does not apply to or embrace the case of defendants, because there is not in question an adverse interest touching any property or right of property of the bankrupt. The act declares that \u201c no suit at law by such assignee shall in any case\u25a0 be maintainable in any court whatsoever, unless brought within two years.\u201d If this be the correct reading of the text, the act is very explicit, and leaves no room for construction. It is true that the previous part of the section had provided for a concurrent jurisdiction of the Circuit with the District court \u201cin all suits at law and in equity which may be brought by any assignee of the bankrupt against any person claiming an adverse interest, or by such person against such assignee touching any property or rights of property of said bankrupt, transferrable to or vested in such as-signee.\u201d Confining the jurisdiction to the cases thus designated, yet is this designation both of Courts and persons, not only not continued, but expressly excluded by the us\u00e9 of the terms in the clause of limitation-, \u201c no suit in any cause in any court whatever.\u201d So also, whilst the preceding part of the act specifies suits brought by an assignee against persons claiming an adverse interest, this latter uses the terms \u201cby such assignees,\u201d without any qualification.\nWe are the better satisfied with this* view of the subject in consideration of the very peculiar character of this law, the object of which was to secure a prompt and efficient administration and settlement of the estate of all bankrupts, within a limited period. Thus by the 10th section, it is made the duty of the court \u201c to order and dir\u00e9ct a collection of the assets, and a reduction of the same to money, and a distribution thereof at as early periods as practicable,\u201d \u2014 dividends are required to be made \u201c as often as once in six months from the time of the decree declaring bankruptcyand \u201c all the proceedings in bankruptcy in each case shall, if practicable, be \u25a0finally adjusted, settled and brought to a close by the Court within two years after the decree declaring the bankruptcy.\u201d\nIf will cease to be regarded as singular that the law requires the assignee to commence suits within two years, when by the same law it is made his duty to adjust, settle, and finally bring to a close, all the proceedings in the case within the same period. Concurring with the Court in overruling the demurrer to these pleas, it remains to enquire whether the court erred in giving judgment absolutely for defendants. By the Common Law, judgment followed the decision on a demurrer as matter of course, it being considered as a confession by matter of record of the facts pleaded. The law in force in this State, provides that \u201cno demurrer shall be considered as an admission of the facts set forth in the pleadings demurred to, so as to bar the person demurring from any substantial claim or defence which he might have urged if said demurrer had not been filed.\u201d Duval 95. If application had been made to the court below to withdraw the demurrer, and for permission to reply to the pleas, we do not hesitate to say that the Court should have granted it; but this was not done ; on the contrary, plaintiff has abided by his demurrer, by taking his writ of error. How then can this Court decide that the party has been barred from a substantial claim or defence he might have urged ? How determine that there is a substantial claim or defence when none has been preferred ?\nIt is at his option on overruling his demurrer, to withdraw it, or allow it to stand. If he does not withdraw it, it concludes his case. He is here entitled to the decision of this Court- on the correctness of the judgment overruling his demurrer, and could also have claimed our decision on a like judgment in overruling his motion to be permitted to reply to the pleas after the decision on his demurrer. The jurisdiction of the Court is appellate merely, to re-examine and to rejudge \u2014 to correct erroneous decisions already made \u2014 it is not a jurisdiction to determine in the first instance cases or questions which have not been submitted to the decision of the Judge below.\nBeing of opinion that there is no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court, it is ordered that the same be affirmed.!",

Thomas Douglas presiding.\n. The declaration set forth that William H. Francis, since a bankrupt, on the 17th February, 1842, recovered a judgment against Thomas Brown and Ellen A. Duval, since intermarried with William H. Brockenbro.ugh, Administrator and Administratrix of Samuel H. Duval, for the sum of $350 38-100, to be levied of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of said,Samuel H. Duv.al, jn the hands of .the said Thomfi's Brown and Ellen A. Duval, administrator and administratrix, to be administered'; \u2014 that an execution on 22d March, 1842, issued on the .said judgment, and was returned on 22d July, 1.842, \u201cno property found!;\u201d \u2014 that. William H. Francis had been on the 7th May, 1842, declared a bankrupt, under the act of Congress, approved 19th August, 1841, entitled \u201can act to establish an uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States,\u201d and that plaintiff had been appointed his assignee ; \u2014 and that after the rendition of'the afpresaid judgment, Ellen A. Duval had intermar. ried with the defendant, William H. Brockenbrough. The clecla-ration averred that at the time the said judgment was rendered, divers goods and chattels, which were of the said Samuel H. Duval at. the tim\u00e9 of his death, to the value of $350 38-100, had come to the hands of the said Thomas Brown and Ellen A. Duval, administrator and administratrix of the said Samuel, to be administered, and suggested a devastavit.\nDefendants pleaded \u2014 1. Nil debet: \u2014 2. Nul teil record: \u2014 -3. That by the 8th section of the act of Congress, approved ,19th August, 1841, entitled \u201c an act to establish an uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States,\u201d it is declared and enacted in substance, that no suit at law or in equity shall in any case be maintainable by or against such assignee,.(meaning any assignee lawfully appointed under the act) or by or against any person claiming an adverse interest, touching the property arid rights of property aforesaid in any court whatsoever, unless the same shall be brought within two years after the, declaration or .decree of bankruptcy; or after the cause of suit shall first have accrued ; and av,erred that suit was brought on 15th April, 1845, which was more than two years after the declaration and decree of bankruptcy of the said Francis; and more than two years after the cause of suit first accrued. 4. That suit was not brought within two years after the decree and declaration of bankruptcy of Francis; nor within two years after the, cause of suit first accrued. 5: That the decree and declaration of bankruptcy was not made, nor did the, caus\u00e9 of suit in the declaration mentioned, first accrue'to plaintiff within two years next before his suit was brought.\nTo 1st, 3d, 4th and 5th pleas plaintiff demurred, and took issue on the 2d. '\nThe Court sustained the demurrer to the 3d plea, and after inspecting the record, found for plaintiff ori issue joined on 2d' plea ; but'overruled the demurrers to the'1, 4 and 5 pleas, and gave judgment for defendant.\nL. A. Thompson and .T.'H. Hagner, for Plaintiff in error:\nOn the 15th April, 1845, James T. Archer,. Assignee in Bankruptcy of Wm. H. Francis, brought an action of debt against the administrators of Samuel H. Duval, upon a judgment rendered in favor of William H. Francis before his bankruptcy, to Wit on 17th February, 1842, against the same administrators^ of Samuel H. Du-val for $350 38-100, to be levied of assetts in hand. The declaration recites the judgment and execution, and return nidia bona;\u2014 that on 7th May, 1842, said Francis was. declared a bankrupt, and on same day plaintiff was appointed his assignee. The. declaration then suggests desastamt in the usual form.\nThe defendants pleaded sundry pleas. It is only necessary to call the attention of the Court to the 1st, 4th, and 5th pleas.\nThe defendants pleaded \u2014 1st, 'nil debet, to which was demurrer. \u2022 The Court overruled the demurrer, and gave judgment final thereon. This we hold was error. Judgment should have been respondeat ouster. \u25a0 \u25a0 , ' 1\nDefendants\u2019 4th plea is of limitations, grounded upon the -8th section of\u2019the Bankrupt Law-r-the plea is \u201cthat plaintiff\u2019s suit was not brought within two years after the.cause of suit first accrued.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s 5th plea is also of limitations \u2014 \u201c that the declaration and decree of bankruptcy, in the declaration mentioned, was not made, nor did the cause of suit in the-declaration mentioned first' accrue to said plaintiff at any time' within two years next before this suit was brought against the said defendants in this behalf\u201d\n/.To each of these pleas .the plaintiff filed a general demurrer.\u2014 There was joinder, and the Court, (Thomas Douglas, Judge,) gave judgment, \u201cthat the said pleas- of the said defendants, by them firstly-fourthly and fifthly, above pleaded,, are sufficient in law to bar the said plaintiff from haying or maintaining his aforesaid action against them the said defendants,\u201d &c.\u2019&c. \u2014 \u201cAnd therefore, it. is considered by the Court, that the., said plaintiff take nothing by his said suit, but that he in mercy,\u201d &c.\nThe plaintiff in error insisted that these pleas, and the matters therein set up, are no bar to his action. \u2022 \u25a0\nThe question is one of construction of the 8th section of the bankrupt law of the United States.\nThe 8th section enacts \u2014 \u201c And no suit at law or in equity shall, in any case, be maintainable by or against such assignee, or by or against any person, claiming an adverse interest touching the property and rights of property aforesaid, in any court whatsoever, unless .the same shall be brought within two years after the declaration and decree of bankruptcy, or after the'cause of suit shall first have accrued.\nThey insisted that this bar does not apply. Here is not a case of adverse \u25a0interest touching any property or right of property of the bankrupt. The bankrupt held this judgment. The right to it was never in contest. The defendants, against whom it was rendered) surely have no adverse interest in the property, in this judgment.\u2014 The bar designed by the statute to apply to a case of conflicting claims to property or rights of property, has been made to apply to a case where the right of property is clear and undisputed*\nThey referred the Court to the Bankrupt Act in the Acts of 1841, published by authority, and particularly to pages 14th, 15th, sec. 8.\nThe counsel for the plaintiff in error have been able to find no adjudication on the limitation clause of this Bankrupt Act, and can therefore turn the Court to no authority.\nA. E. Maxwell, for Defendants in error;\nHe relied upon the 8th section of the Bankrupt act, to show that the 4th and 5th pleas are good, and that the demurrers to them were rightly overruled. The assignee derives his power to sue from the 3d section, and he can sue in no other case than is therein embraced ; and by comparison of that section with the 8th, it will be found that the eases barred after two years, are co-extensive with the cases where the assignee has power to sue \u2014 consequently, all cases which he can bring into court are subject to the bar given by the 8th section, if two years have passed before suit.\nThe argument that this is not a case of adverse interest touching the property or rights of property of the bankrupt, proves too much. If not, the plaintiff has no right to be in this Court; for the 3d section does not authorise him to sue, except in such cases, and he cannot go beyond the authority there conferred on him. But giving' the statute a proper construction, this is a case within its meaning. The interest of the plaintiff in the judgment is adverse to that of the defendant, and it is, also, a case \u201c touching\u201d \u2014 in other words, relating to or concerning \u2014 the judgment, which was the \u201c property\u201d of the bankrupt; not, to be sure, a case where the right to the judgment is involved, but one touching or relating to the property, viz : the judgment.\nBut independent of this, the bar extends to \u201c any case\u201d by or against the assignee, which is Certainly broad enough to cover this case, whatever be its character."
