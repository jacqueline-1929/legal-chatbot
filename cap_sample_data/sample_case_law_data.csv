"Charles D. Stewart, vs. Thomas Preston, Jr.",1 Fla. 1,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baltzelü, Justice,
delivered the opinion of the Court:
This is a case from the docket of the late Court of Appeals of the Territory, having been transferred by act of the Legislature to the docket of this Court.
A motion is made to dismiss, on the ground that the appeal having been taken to that Court, this Court being a Court of the State, has no jurisdiction to dispose of it. • •
A question to the jurisdiction is. at all times a delicate one, and would have influenced the Court to pause and hesitate, before assuming it in this case, if the power had been at'all doubtful. But we see no room to question the jurisdiction. The act of, the Legislature of the State, organizing the Supreme Court, is imperative, “ that all “ cases now pending in said Court of Appeals, shall be transferred “ to said Supreme Court, and tried, arid decided therein, and thereby, “ except cases cognizable by the Federal Courts.” Acts 1845, p. 14, sec. 14.
We see no cause for questioning the power of the Legislature to pass this law, and none has been alleged in argument. There was obviously a necessity for it, from the fact that cases appealed from, must be disposed of by some tribunal, and who so appropriate as the jurisdiction, under the new organization, taking the place of, and substituted for the old one. We do not concur in the opinion of coun-ael, that if this Court does not take jurisdiction, the judgment of the Court below is revived; on the contrary, we strongly incline to the opinion that the appeal suspends the judgment, until some superior tribunal makes a rightful disposition of the case.
But the question occurs, is this case exempt from the jurisdiction of the Court, by being cognizable in the Federal Court. If so, it must be in a Circuit Court of the U. S. or a District Court having Circuit Court powers, vested with appellate jurisdiction. The law of Congress on the subject provides, “ That final decrees and judg- “ ments in civil cases in a District Court, when the matter in dispute “ exceeds the sum or value of $50, may be re-examined and reversed “or affirmed in a Circuit Court on a writ of error,” &c. Story’s laws, 60.
Does an appeal lie to the Supremo Court of the United States? The act of Congress provides, “ That final judgments' and decrees in “ civil actions and suits in Equity in a Circuit Court, brought there “ by original process, or removal there from Courts of the several “ States, or by appeal from a District Court, when the matter in dis- “ pute exceeds #2000, may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed “in-the Supreme Court.” Story, 61.
But it is alleged that the citizenship of the party, or alienage, in some of the cases pending before the Court, creates a difference in favor of the application. The laws of Congress referring to the subject, contain the following provisions :
“ The Circuit Courts shall have original cognizance concurrent with the Courts of the several States, of all suits of a civil nature at “ common law or in equity, where the matter in dispute^ exclusive “ of costs, exceeds the value of $500, and the United Stares are “ plaintiffs or petitioners, or an alien is a party, or the suit is between “ a citizen of the State where the suit is brought and a citizen of aa- “ other State.” Story, 57.
“ That if a suit be commenced in any State Court against an alien, “ or by a citizen of the State in which the suit is brought against “ the citizen of another State, the matter in dispute exceeding five “ hundred dollars, and the defendant shall, at the time of entering “his appearance in such State Court, file his petition for the re - “ moval of the cause for trial into the next Circuit Court, on giving “ bail, &c.; the cause shall there proceed as if brought by original “process.” Story, 58.
These two provisions are inapplicable to the case of an appeal from another tribunal, and were designed for suits in their original institution, and before judgment. ,
None of these laws of the U. S. nor any others we have been able to find, provide for the transfer by appeal or writ of error of a judgment rendered by the Superior Court of a Territory to a District or Circuit Court, or to the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case then must be tried by this Court, or not tried at all. Were it a case of admiralty, or other case exclusively cognizable by the United States Courts, the Court would at once make the transfer, as has been already done in cases on the docket; but it is not of this character — on the contrary, being a case for the recovery of money, and within the ordinary common law jurisdiction of Courts, it is clearly within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.
For these reasons, we think the case is rightfully before the Court, and the motion is therefore overruled. '
Per Curiam. Motion overruled."
"Charles D. Stewart, vs. Thomas Preston, Jr.",1 Fla. 10,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Bax.tzei,l, Justice:
This is an appeal from a judgment of the late Superior Court for the County of Gadsden, rendered on a petition filed by appellant to obtain the foreclosure of a mortgage, under the Statute “ to regulate “ the foreclosure of mortgages by the Courts of Common Law, and “ for other purposes.”
The plea filed by defendant is, “ that the mortgage was executed and delivered to Edward Carey and others, to indemnify them as endorsers on certain notes therein named; that it was intended by the terras thereof to operate only as a personal covenant of indemnity, and therefore not subject to the operation of the assignment set forth in the petition, nor does the assignment convey such an interest as would give him the right to foreclose against the respondent.”
An examination of the deed will at once show the fallacy of the position that it was given for indemnity merely. It is true the recital of the instrument expresses its “ purpose to be the securing Carey and the other endorsers from any damage, loss or liability, in consequence of their endprsements,” but the conveyance is made subject to “ the conditions and stipulations, that if Preston shall pay all and “ each of the notes as they become due, and not make default in any “ of them, then the above obligation to be void, and the title thereby “ conveyed ; and it was further expressly stipulated, that if Preston “ shall fail in payment of said notes and suffer the same to be protes- “ ted, or to remain over due in whosoever hands the same he found, “ then the said Carey and others, on making affidavit of such non“payment, and the amount thereof, shall be permitted to foreclose the “ mprtgage, take out execution and bring to sale the said negroes, or “ any portion necessary to the payment of the sum due, notwilhstand- “ ing said sum may not have been' paid or any part thereof, by said “ Carey and others.”
We are not permitted in the construction of this or any other instrument, to consider one part to the exclusion of another, but must look at the whole to perceive the design of the maker of it. Indemnity was certainly its purpose, but there was an- object beyond this, plainly expressed, by which indeed it was to be accomplished, which was to provide for “payment of the notes,” and payment in whoso- “ ever hands the same might he found.” It is on payment alone of the notes that the “ title conveyed and the obligation are to be void,” and extraordinary means are provided to coerce payment even before the endorsers sustain any damage. Now if indemnity had been the sole object, these provisions would have been excluded, and others introduced to the effect that the title and obligation should be void on the endorsers being relieved or released from their responsibility. Such however is not the case.
It is then in the opinion of the Court not a mortgage of indemnity to the endorsers merely, but to secure the payment of the notéis in addition. The decision of this point carries with it the other one taken by defendant’s counsel dependent upon it, that being for indemnity merely, the mortgage was not assignable. As a general rule the endorsement of the notes secured by a mortgage carries with it the mortgage ; this has not been denied in argument, and it has not been deemed necessary to cite authorities in support of it. In the present case there is an endorsement by Carey and others, to the plaintiff “ without recourse,” and we proceed to enquire as to its effect upon the transfer of the mortgage.
“ A qualified endorsement in no respect affects the negotiability of “ the instrument, but simply qualifies the duties,- obligations and 'res- “ ponsibilities of the endorser resulting from the general principles “ of law. Thus for example an endorsement of a note to A, without ‘‘recourse will not restrain the negotiability of the note, but willsim- “ ply exclude any responsibility of the endorser on the non-accep- “ tance or non-payment thereof.” Story on Prom, notes 160, Section 146.
The form of such an endorsement best expresses its nature and character: “ James Atkins sans recourse or James Atkins with in- “ tent only to transfer my interest, and not to be subject to any liability “ in case of non-acceptance or non-payment.” Story on Notes, 149 ; Chitty on Bills, 250 — 251.
Whatever interest then would pass by a general or full endorsement, it seems will pass by a qualified endorsement. If right in this respect, the endorsement in this case carried with it the right and interest of the mortgage, as it certainly did the right to the note itself. This however is not so material, as there is a direct assignment and transfer of the mortgage by Carey and others, the grantees, to the plaintiff. It is alleged that this is invalid on account of the erasure of the words Bank of Columbus, and interlineation of the name of plaintiff, but the law is too well settled to admit of controversy on this point: “ An interlineation or erasure apparent on the face of “ the deed,” says Chief Justice Marshal, in the case of Speake and others, vs. The United States, “ does not of itself avoid it. T.o pro- “ duce this effect it must be shown to have been done under circumstances that the law does not warrant.” 9 Cranch, 28 ; 3 Condensed rep. 244.
In that case the facts were distinctly put in issue by the plea of non est factum, - whereas in the case under consideration, there is neither averment nor proof that the alteration was illegally or improperly made.
We might here close our examination of the case, having disposed of the objections raised by defendant in his pleading, and show a clear and sufficient right in the plaintiff to recover. All other de-fences, according to the rules of pleading, are considered as waived, especially such as are connected with the facts of the' case ; and the rule in this respect is founded upon principles of justice and proprie-' ty. Where .a defence is made in appropriate season, the opposing party may prepare'to meet it, to explain' and remove'whatever may be prejudicial to his case. But when made at an unsuitable time, it may surprise, and if received, do injury and injustice.
' With these rvemarks, we proceed tó notice objections urged in this Court by defendant’s counsel with great zeal, and on which great reliance has been placed, which though not presented by the defence below, it maybe more satisfactory to have cbnsidered. “ That the mortgage was made and delivered Upon a ;state of circumstances which afteryards became changed and altered, and to effect purposes afterwards abandoned, and that in truth the.deed was delivered upon conditions not performed. -The notes were endorsed by them without recourse, that endorsement wás contemporaneous with the making of the notes in point of law, and thus evinces an entire change of the original design of the parties. In argument it was said, that Carey and others, never were bound, they did not become liable on Preston’s account, they never were sureties at all, they never run any.risk on his account,” 1 ’ ,~
If all this be true, it was certainly most material to Preston’s de-fence ; it must have been known to him at the time of filing his plea and his failure to rely upon it, if not entirely at variance with its, existence, to say the least, is wholly inexplicable. The position “ that Carey and Others, were never sureties, por liable on Preston’s account, nor run any risk for him,” is rather broad, considering' the character of the deed and its provisions, declaring expressly that'they had endorsed for him, and had become his securities.” The other points are based oh the'assumption that “the endorsement of Carey and,others, was contemporaneous with the making of the notes in point of law,” and that Prestop derived no benefit or advantage from it.
Such a presumption would be a very forced one, opposed as it is to the recital óf the deed, declaring that they had endorsed -in blank, to its objects and'pufposes — its delivery and possessión by plaintiff, and the direct object and end of Preston in making and procuring them all. The notes are payable at either of the Banks in Columbus, and were obviously designed for discount..' The fact of the endorsement sho.ws that he could not get money, on his own credit, or the discount without endorsers may have been., against the rules of the Bank; hence he procured them — that he could not get it on endorsement alone ; hence he gave a security on property. Now that Preston, after completing his arrangement and before presenting the notes for discount, should have filled up the endorsement so as to destroy the liability oí the endorsers, is wholly incredible ; the more so if the effect of the act were to invalidate the mortgage also. He would then, according to the argument of defendant’s counsel, have presented his notes for discount with no security. But if the endorsement was of no use to him nor the mortgage either, why not destroy them and substitute his individual note in their place ? He certainly could not in honesty and fairness have presented a note secured apparently with endorsement and mortgage, for discount, which he knew' at the time to be invalid and worthless. We will not presume a state of facts so injurious to fair dealing and common, honesty. Oh the contrary the fair and rational inference is, that these instruments Were made for an object which was attained, and that they were of use to him. The fair presumption is that the notes were discounted whilst the endorsements were in blank, on the faith of them and the mort. gage, and that the endorsers either took them up by payment or otherwise, and'afterwards transferred’them to the present holder, he taking them with the qualified endorsement; or that the endorsers, the notes having been discounted at Bank, bargained for their exoneration from the endorsement by giving an assignment of the mortgage, an arrangement which they had a right to make, and which Preston could not object to, as by it, his purpose of saving his endorsers through means of a deed made expressly for that object, was fully attained.
We have seen, however, that the effect of the qualified endorsement was to transfer the right and interest of the mortgage, so that the effect would be the same, whether the endorsement was filled up contemporaneously with the note or afterwards. If the Bank, or party negotiating the notes, dispensed with the endorsement, so far as to take it without recourse, their design must have been to rely on the mortgage ; and from the fact that it was not discharged, or in any way cancelled, but placed on the record found in possession of plaintiff, the inference is conclusive that Preston regarded it as valid, and a subsisting security. Strong as the above positions are, they are fortified by the fact that credits appear oil the note for monies received by plaintiff of defendant, to nearly half his indebtedness.
We fully concur in the position taken by defendant’s counsel, that the mortgage created a trust for the payment of the notes, and that Carey and others might, in a proper case, have been decreed to allow the use of their names, if necessary to a suit, fo have the mortgaged property applied to their payment. This-was’not necessary in this case, as they have assigned their mortgage to plaintiff.
Upon the whole, we are of opinion that the judgment of the Court below was erroneous and should be reversed. ' It is therefore considered by the Court, that the judgment of the Superior Court be, and the same is hereby reversed and set aside!,'with costs.' And it is further ordered, that this case be remitted to the Circuit Court for the county of-Gadsden, for farther proceedings to be had in conformity to this opinion.
Per curiam. ' Judgment reversed."
"Richard Whitaker, vs. Charles Morrison",1 Fla. 25,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Hawkins, Justice:
Assumpsit by the appellee, Morrison, as the endorse^ of the following promissory note, against the appellant, .Whitaker, as an endorser thereof:— •
“ No. — Tallahassee, August 18 th, 1837.
“ Sixty days after date,-1 promise \ to pay .to. the. order of Thomas “ Brown, at the Central Bank of Florida, Thirty-five hundred Dol-
“ lars and-cents, value received.

“May 10th, 1843 — Rec’d irom R. Whitaker on acc. $1406 51- “ 100 dolls. H. L. R. May, 10, 1838. Rec’d on acc. $891 75 “ —rec’d 24th March, 1838.”
The declaration contains a count on the note, setting out the endorsement from Brown to Whitaker, and from him to the plaintiff, and the usual money counts. It also avers that the note sued upon, was duly presented to Maner, the maker, and payment demanded, which was refused, and that (the appellant) Whitaker, had notice thereof.
The defendant pleaded non-assumpsit, issue joined, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff.
In. support of his action, the plaintiff offered in evidence the original note and protest. John J. Rowles, a witness for plaintiff, testified to the truth of the facts as set forth in the protest, viz: — That he duly presented for payment the note sued upon, at the time it fell due, at the Central Bank, where it was made payable ; which was refused. That it was-his invariable habit to give notice Jo endorsers, when a note was protested by him; in case they lived in town to give personal notice, and if in the country, directed to the nearest post office. Believes that notice was given to the endorser, Whita-kef, through the post office’, directed to-Tallahassee, the one at which he received his letters. .That it was his habit to make' a memorandum on the copy of the protest kept by him, and.not on the one now exhibited-. • That this copy was lost. That he did not remember an instance in the whole course of his life, in which he failed to give»notice, on refusal to pay by the maker. That his usual way of doing business, induced him to believe that notice was given defendant, but could recollect no circumstance about this case, and that he did not recollect to have put a notice in the post office for Whitaker, or to have presented the note and demanded payment thereof. That he had no recollection of the matter whatever, ex'cept from the papers shown him. That he recollected to have put letters containing notice of notes falling due, or of protest, in the post office for defendant, but had no recollection of this case. That the answers which he had given were not from knowledge and recellection, but from his habits of doing business, and that he had no knowledge as to the post office of defendant, and that he did not them know where he resided.
Henry L. Rutgers, also sworn for the plaintiff, proved the credit given, upon the note on May 18,1838, and that he received the money from the defendant, Whitaker..' '
On the part of the defendant, Leslie A. Thompson was called, who testified that he was cashier of-the Central Bank at the time of the transfer to the Union Bank. That in 1837, William Maner, the maker of the note, was indebted to the .Central Bank in a large sum of money, and that it had received from Maner, 'heavy collateral security, which was good. The 'defendant also introduced William Maner, the maker of the note, who testified, .that the money credited upon the note, as received from Whitaker, was his. That he furnished Whitaker with the same, with a request that he would pay it to the Union Bank, (at that time)'the holddr o'f the note.
The defendant at the trial prayed the Court to instruct the Jury, that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover against the defendant, because sufficient legal notice of the non-paymenthad not been given defendant, nor due diligence used :to fix the endorser. This- instruc-fion the Court refused to give, and instructed the jury, that due 'and legal notice of non-payment of the nóte' sued on, was sufficient to es. tablish the liability of the defendant ds etidpiser.
The defendant excepted, and thg .verdict' and judgment being against'him, he appealed to this Court.;'
It is contended for by the appellant s'
That upon the record, the plaintiff in the Court below was not entitled to recover against the defendant.
2d. That the liability of appellant* as endorser on the note sued on, was extinguished by the maker becoming an endorser thereon, subsequent to the endorsement of defendant,? and that no recovery could be had against him on his said endorsement.
3d. That sufficient notice of the non-payment of the note, at its maturity, was not given by the holder théfeof to defendant, to fix his liability as endorser.
4th. That upon the evidence, the Court should have instrflbted the jury, that plaintiff’was not entitled to recover!
On the"" part of .the appellee, it is contended:.
That the evidence of notice to the defendant in the Court below, was sufficient, and that due diligence had been used, and that even if not sufficient, the payment by Whitaker to. the Bank, the holder previous, to the appellee,, was an admission of notice, and waiver of his rights as endorser as. to the requirement of notice of the demand upon the maker, and his refusal to pay, and as such, sustained the averment of notice as set forth in the declaration.
It is also contended for the appellee, that inasmuch as the second point, viz: — the re-endorsement to the-defendant, was not taken in the Court below, and does-not come up to this Court in the bill of Exceptions, it is not the province of this Court to notice it, and adjudicate thereupon, and in support of this, cites 16 Peters’ U. S. R. 618.
The Court will, in their decision, only notice those points which appear directly decisive of the case.
The first question is : Whether Whitaker, the appellant, ha,S received due and proper notice of the dishonor of the note sued upon ? And,
Secondly: If such notice was not given, whether there has been any act on the part of Whitaker, amounting to a waiver of proof of demand and notice.
The true and correct inquiry, in all cases of this nature, seems to be, whether the holder of the note has made use of due and reasonable diligence to bring home notice of the dishonor of the note, to the party whose contingent liability depends upon his having such notice. Due diligence on the part of the holder to obtain payment from the maker being a condition precedent, on which the liability of the endorser depends, it is well settled must be proved, to enable the party to recover. The attention of the Court has been called by the counsel for the appellant to Chitty on Bills, page 646, (9 Am. ed.) where it is laid down, in speaking of the requisite proof of the fact of notice to the endorser, that the notice must be “ proved precisely, and not left to inference, at what time and in what manner, the letter (containing notice) was sent.
The law in relation to this matter seems clearly laid down. In an action by the endorsee against the endorser of a bill of Exchange, a witness*testified, that either two or three days after the dishonor of the bill, notice was given by letter to defendant. Notice in two days being sufficient and in time, but notice on the third too late. Lord Ellenborough said : “ The witness says, two or three days, but “ the third day would be too late. It lies upon you to show that no- “ tice was given in due time, and I cannot go upon proháble evidence, “ without positive proof of tho fact.” Byles on Bills, 163, citing Lawson and another, assignee ofShifner vs. Sherwood, 1 Starkie R. 314.
In Hetherington vs. Kemp, 4 Campbell’s .nisi prius cases, 192, the only qüestión was, whether the defendant had received due notice of the dishonor of a bill of exchange. Lord Ellenborough lays it down in this case, that even general evidence of a course of business, is not sufficient to carry with’it proof of the' dishonor of a bill: The facts were proved, that the plaintiff after the bill was due, wrote a letter containing d statement of its dishonor to the defendant; that this letter was put on a table, where according.to the usage of his counting house, letters for the post- were always deposited, and that a porter carried them from thence to the post office. But the porter was not called, and there was no evidence as to what became of the letter, after it was placed upon the table. ■ .
In Flack vs. Green, 3 Gill & Johnson, page 47'5, it was proposed to give in evidence, and prove as to the giving of notice,“ that it was “ the invariable and uniform practice"" of the endorsers house and “ counting room to which the notices had been directed, to forward “such notices immediately upon their receipt, and the witnesses “ who were employed in such counting room, had. no doubt, and “.believed from the course, of their business,- that they had forwarded “one of-the notices to the other endorser.” This being the only evidence adduced as to the notice of dishonor,, it was ruled out in the Court below, as being incompetent and inadmissible, and the opinion of the'Court below was sustained by'the Court of Appeals of the State of Maryland.
From these and the general current of authorities, there seems no doubt, that proof of demand, and notice of dishonor of a bill or note, must not rest on mere inference or light presumptions, but must be of a stronger and more affirmative character.
Reasonable notice is a compound of law and fact; but when the facts are clearly ascertained, becomes a question of law, and is to be decided by the Court. 3 Wendell, 75. 2 Peter’s U. S. R. 100. The facts in this case are of a nature as to render them a- question of law. The inquiry now arises, was the proof of notice in the Court below, of a character to bring it within the purview and spirit of the .rules of evidence as laid down, ¿s to the requisite notice to be given in cases of dishonor of a bill or note ? Rowles, the sole witness as to the notice, testifies that it was his invariable habit to give notice, and believes that he gave it in this case — that he could recollect no circumstance as to the present instance — and had no recollection except from the papers shown him — and winds up his testimony by saying, that the answers he gave were not from knowledge or recollection, but from his habits of doing business.
His evidence is based on belief, without knowledge or recollection, and that belief arising too from the simple incident, his habit of doing business; and indeed by a close inspection, it seems but little more than vague conjecture, or at most, slight presumption.
The law requires something of a more explicit and definite-character, and we are clearly of opinion that the Court below erred in not giving the instruction as prayed for by the defendant’s counsel, as to the insufficiency of the testimony- in relation to the notice.
The next question remaining for the consideration of the Court is: Whether as contended for by appellee, there has been a waiver of want of notice, or laches of the holder of the note, by the appellant —that payment by Whitaker was a direct admission of notice.
To support the affirmative of this proposition, the appellee relies on the evidence of Rutgers, while the appellant assumes the negative, and endeavors to rebut the evidence- of Rutgers by that of Manor.
There can be no doubt, that payment on a note or a promise to pay, after full knowledge of the default, precludes a party making one or the other, from insisting on a want of notice; but the promise must be clear, explicit and unconditional,- and the facts of such a nature as to clearly warrant the presumption of a waiver; and in 2 Starkie on evidence 272, it is said that part payment amounts to the strongest of all evidence as to waiver, affording presumptive proof, that all things have been rite acta, Vaughn, vs. Fuller, 2 Strange, 1246; Buller N. P. 276 ; 6 Burr, 26, 70. Thornton, vs. Wynn, 12 Wheat. 183 ; 16 John, R. 152; 1 Martin and Yerger, 74. Judge Story in speaking of the doctrine of waiver says: “ if he makes such a waiver in “ ignorance of facts he will not be bound thereby — but if with full “ knowledge, he will. Indeed, a promise by the party entitled to no- “ tice, to pay the bill, is deemed a full and complete waiver of the “ want of notice, and payment of part of the money due on the Bill “ will have the same effect. But then in all cases of this sort, the “ promise must be unequivocal, and amount to an admission of the “ right of the holder; or the act done must he of a nature clearly im- “ porting a like admission of his right '. If it be defective in either « respect, or if it be a conditional offer of payment, then and in such “ case, the holder has no right to insist upon it as a waiver.” Story on Bills, page 363, 4, 5 and 6; Cayuga Bank, vs. Dill, 5 Hill, 103,‘ The part payment of a note not explained or qualified by any accompanying circumstances, will be held to be sufficient evidence of waiver of notice; 450 Story on ^romisl^ry -Notes; and on page 454 of the same work, he lays it down among the cases which will not constitute sufficient excuse for the want of due notice of the dishonor of a note, where the maker in contemplation of his inability to pay the whole note at maturity, has lodged money with the Indorser for part payment thereof, when due.
The evidence of Rutgers, certainly makes out a prima facia case of payment, with its legal consequences, on the note by Whitaker, and but, that it is rebutted by the direct and'positive evidence of Maner, would entitled the appellee to all the benefits arising from a waiver on-the part of Whitaker, were it shewn likewise that the payment was not made under a mistake or ignorance of facts. But Maner’s testimony is clear and direct; he says that the money was his, not Whitaker’s, and paid in accordance with his request; and v/e think, that this evidence, using the words of Judge Story, so “ qualifies and explains” the transaction, as to preclude all idea of an actual or intended waiver on the part of Whitaker.
There was no evidence shewing a promise of payment on the part of Whitaker, and the bare fact of his delivering the money is not enough — as to this, Whitaker seems to have acted as the mere agent of Maner, and it wotild be at variance with all ideas of justice, explained as the occurrence is, that Whitaker, acting in the capacity of an agent simply, should be rendered subject to legal liabilities, by the virtual act of his principal.
Liabilities for the acts of others may be created either by a direct authority given for their performance, or it may flow from the adbption, or in some instances from acquiescence in those acts. But presumptions can only stand when they are compatible with the conduct of those to whom it may be sought to apply them ; and still more must give place, when in conflict with, clear, distinct and convincing proof; 16 Peter’s, U. S. R. 331..
Could Whitaker, by any possibility, recover the money endorsed upon the note in an action, for so much money paid for the use of Maner ? It is true the payment enured to the benefit of Whitaker, in lessening his liability pro tanto upon the note; but a payment by any body else would have the same effect, and we cannot think, that there existed that privity between Maner and Whitaker, as to have produced that identity, contended for by the appellee. The evidence of Rutgers does not extend beyond the receiving of the money from Whitaker, and his indorsing it by way of credit upon the note ; but there is no evidence to shew that Whitaker intended, wished or directed, that the delivery of the money should be considered as a pay-
ment specifically made by him, thereby rendering himself liable to the legal consequences arising from the act.
But the presumptions which might otherwise arise in this case from the face of the paper sued upon, must give way to facts clearly and unequivocally stated in the evidence ofManer; and this Court cannot permit the inferences arising from the act of.a party opposed in interest, however innocently done, to weigh against positive and direct proof.
It is a general rule, that an endorser once discharged by want of notice or laches of the holder, is always discharged, and he cannot again be rendered liable, except by some voluntary act or agreement. If an act, it must be clear and unequivocal, and incapable of explanation or qualification; if an agreement, it must be so clear, that a new promise is inferred, and the original liabilities by force of this promise incurred anew.
In this case at least, the waiver should have been established, in clear evidence, and not upon suppositions arising from .the act of third persons, or the peculiar and adventitious situation of parties.
With these views, the Court is of opinion, that the Court below erred in not giving the direction to the jury as prayed for, in relation to due diligence and requisite notice on the part of the plaintiff, Morrison ; and that the facts, as before us, do not constitute a waiver, oñ the part of Whitaker, of such diligence and notice, or an admission of notice by Whitaker.
It is therefore Ordered, that the judgment in .the Court below be reversed, and that a venire da novo be awarded.
Per curiam,. Judgment reversed, and venire de novo."
"Frederick R. Cotten, vs. Robert W. Williams, Trustee, &c.",1 Fla. 37,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Douglas, Chief Justice:
This is an action of debt, instituted by Robt. W. Williams, Trustee, &c., against Frederick R. Cotten, in the Superior Court of the Middle District of Florida, for Leon county, upon a written instrument, a copy of which is contained in the bill of exceptions, that makes a part of the record in this cause.
The declaration contains two counts — the first upon said written instrument, and the second upon an account stated.
The pleas are — First: Non est factum — (not sworn to.) Second: A special plea, alleging: “ That long after the said writing obligato ry had been signed, sealed and delivered, by John'S. Taylor, John Taylor, and Henry B, Bradford, to Wm. B. Nuttall, Hector W. Braden and Wm. P. Craig, as their joint and several deed, and long after it had been endorsed and assigned by the said Braden, Nuttall and Craig, to the Union Bank of Florida, and long after the death of Wm. B. Nuttall, one of the obligees, the said Union Bank procured him, the said defendant, to sign and seal the same, as one of the joint and several obligors or makers thereof; whereby it is not,, and never was of any force or effect whatever, as the joint and several bond of this defendant” — concluding with a verification'. Third: Another special plea’, setting forth that, long after the making, sealing and delivery of the said writing obligatory, by John S. Taylor, John Taylor and Henry B. Bradford, to said Wm. B. Nuttall, Hector W. Braden and Wm. P. Craig, as their joint and several obligation, and ■after the assignment and endorsement thereof by said Nuttall, Bra-den and Craig; to wit: about five years — and long after the death of Wm. B. Nuttall, one of the obligees, to wit: about four years— the said writing obligatory vras altered and changed materially, by the said Union Bank, the ■ endorsee thereof, procuring the name of one Noah Thompson to be added thereto, as a joint and several maker thereof; and also that afterwards, that is to say, after thepro-curing the name of the said Noah Thompson to be added thereto as aforesaid. — to wit: one year — the said Union Bank again altered and changed materially the said writing obligatory, by procuring the name of this defendant tobe added thereto, as a joint and several maker and obligor; whereby, and by means whereof, the said writing obligatory has become, and was rendered void” — concluding as before. Fourth: Nil Debit.
To the second and third pleas, the plaintiff demurred specially. To the second: “ Because the same is inconsistent, insensible, irregular, and defective, and is equivalent to the general issue.” To the Third: Because the same is defective in this — that it avers the said bond sued on, was altered and materially changed, without stating that the same was done without the consent of the defendant; and because the same is inconsistent, argumentative, irregular and defective. To this demurrer there was a joinder; and after argument had thereon, the demurer was sustained in the Court below. The case was submitted to a jury, upon the issues made upon the other two pleas; who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, viz : “ That the defendant owed the debt in the declaration mentioned — three, thousand two hundred and six dollars and twenty-five cents, and nine hundred and forty-eight dollars and sixty-one cents damages; making together the sum of four thousand one hundred and fifty.four dollars and eighty-cents, (besides his costs) — and for this sum judgment was entered. On the trial of this cause in the Court below, the defendant tendered his bill of exceptions, which was signed, sealed, and ordered to be made a part of the record, in the words, following:—
“Robert W. Williams, Trustee, vs. Frederick R. Cotten.”, “In Leon Superior Court, December Term, 1844. Bill of Exceptions.”
Be it remembered, that on the trial of this cause, the plaintiff proved the signatures of John S. Taylor, John Taylor, Henry B. Bradford, Noah Thompson, and Frederick R. Cotten, (the defendant,) to the bond; and the hand writing of Hector W. Braden, William B. Nuttall, and William P. Craig, to the endorsement on the bond, and offered the said bond in evidence.
$3206 25-100. On or before the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, we and each of us promise add oblige ourselves, our heirs, executors, and administrators, to pay to William B. Nuttall, Hector W. Braden and William P. Craig, or their order, the just and full sum of three thousand two hundred and six dollars and twenty-five cents, lawful money of the United States, with interest thereon, at the rate of ten per cent per annum from the time the same shall become due until paid, for value received.— Witness our hands and seals, Tallahassee, the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four.

Defendant objected to the said bond being read in evidence to the jury: Because there was no seal or scrawl to the name of Henry B. Bradford, Noah Thompson, and Frederick R. Cotten, to the bond ; and the same was therefore variant from the instrument declared on, not being the bond or writing obligatory of said persons, or of said Cotten, as declared on.
The Court overruled the objection, and admitted the said instrument in evidence, to which said defendant excepted ; and this bill is signed, sealed, and ordered to be filed, and made a part of the record.
Here the plaintiff rested his case.
Defendant had offered to prove by Henry L, Rutgers, that he was an officer of the Union Bank of Florida, in the months of January and February, 1838, when the bond in suit was negotiated to and delivered to the Union Bank, by Braden and Craig, with the endorsements of themselves and Nuttall; that the bond was subsequently passed by the bank to plaintiff; that while the Bank had and owned the same, the names of Noah Thompson and Frederick R. Cotten were added thereto; witness does not know of any consent on the part of John S. Taylor, John Taylor and Henry B. Bradford, or either of them, to the addition of the names of Noah Thompson and Frederick Cotten, to the said bond, or of any knowledge on their part thereof; nor does he know of any objection being made by the said John S. Taylor, John Taylor and Henry B. Bradford. Witness thinks Col. Wm. B,. Nuttall died in the spring of 1835. James D. Westcott was then called by defendant to prove that Col. Wm. B. Nuttall died on 26th April, lg36 ; which being overruled, was excepted to. This was all the evidence in the case, and to the admission of whjph plaintiff objected; and the objection being sustained, defendant excepted thereto.
Defendants counsel thereupon requested the Court to instruct the jury:
1st. That unless the jury are satisfied, from the evidence, that,the addition of the names of Cotten and Thompson to the bond, was by the consent of John S. Taylor, John Taylor, and Henry Bradford, it vitiates the bond, and plaintiff cannot recover thereon in this action.
2d. That unless the jury are satisfied, from the evidence, that such addition was by consent of John S. Taylor, John Taylor and Henry B. Bradford, the plaintiff cannot recover in this case, as the proof is variant from the declaration.
3d. That if the jury shall believe that, Wm. B. Nuttall died in the spring of the year 1836, and that the defendant signed said bond after his death, the said bond is void as to this defendant, and plaintiff cannot recover in this action.
4th. That defendant and Noah Thompson, having signed the bond after the death of Wm. B. Nuttall, there could be no delivery of the bond to him, and consequently the proof is variant from the declaration, and plaintiff cannot recover in this action.
5th. That if the jury shall be satisfied that the name of the defendant was added to the bond after it had been assigned to the Union Bank, that then the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.
6lh. That unless,the jury shall be satisfied that the name of Thompson was added to the bond by the consent of John S. Taylor, John Taylor and Henry B. Bradford, the bond was vitiated, and rendered void thereby, and the addition of the name of Cotten afterwards would not validate the same.
7th. That there being no seals or scrawls to the names of Henry B.' Bradford, Noah Thompson and defendant, the proof is variant from the declaration, and plaintiff cannot recover in this suit by reason thereof.
8th. That upon the whole evidence the jury should find for the defendant.
The Court refused said instructions, and charged the jury that, upon the evidence, they should find for the plaintiff. To which decision and opinion of the Court, refusing, and giving said instructions, and in refusing to admit said testimony, deponent excepted; and this bill of exceptions is accordingly signed, sealed, and made a part of the case.

Dec. 17th, 1844.
Whereupon the defendant prayed an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the Territory of Florida, which was granted. The cause was carried up to that Court,' and was transferred therefrom into this Court, pursuant to the provisions contained in the last clause of the 17th article, (Schedule and.Ordinance,) of the Constitution of the State, which is as follows: “ And all actions at law, or suits in Chancery, or any proceeding pending, or which may be pending in any Court of the Territory of Florida, may be commenced in, or transferred, to such Court of the State as may have jurisdiction of the subject matter thereof.” And also in pursuance of the provisions of the 14th section of the act of the General Assembly of this State, of July 25th, 1845, entitled, An act to organize the State of Florida, which was passed to carry into effect the above mentioned constitutional provision, so far as regarded, cases pending in said Court of Appeals, and is in the following words, viz: “ That all cases now pending in said Court of Appeals, shall be. transferred to said Supreme Court, and tried and decided therein and thereby, except cases cognizable by the Federal Court, which may be organized in this State, which shall be transferred to such Court.” And all writs of error or appeals from judgments, decrees or decisions heretofore given, or rendered by any of the Superior Courts of the Territory, shall be returned to said Supreme Court, and tried, and decided there - in, and thereby.”
On the first day of the present term of this Court, a motion was made by the plaintiff’s counsel, to dismiss this cause, upon the following grounds, to wit:
First: Because it has no rightful place in this Court; and this Court has no jurisdiction of the sanie, no appeal or writ of error having been sued out, or taken to this Court; and this Court has no appellate jurisdiction in this cause.
Second: Because the judgment of Leon Superior Court is final, until reversed by the proper appellate tribunal, constituted by the acts of Congress of the United States.
Third: Because this Court has appellate jurisdiction only over those Inferior Courts, which the Constitution of the State of Florida hath established, and which compose with this Court, the judiciary powers of the State.”
This motion^ after a full discussion, at the bar, of the questions involved in it, was overruled; and it was intimated that, when the opinion of the Court should be pronounced upon the merits of the case, the reasons for the decision upon the motion would be stated. But since that time, Judge Baltzell has delivered the opinion of the Court, upon a similar motion, upon the same grounds, in the 'case of Charles D. Stewart us. Thomas, Preston, junior, and it has consequently become unnecessary to do more now than to refer to that opinion, in which all the members of the Court concurred.
We proceed, therefore, to consider the errors assigned, which are as follows, to wit :
First: That the Court sustained the demurrer to the two special pleas, and the plea of Nil Debit, improperly.
Second: The Court erred in permitting the instrument of writing, offered by the plaintiff, to be read in evidence.
Third: The Court erred in rejecting the evidence of Henry L. Rutgers, as set forth in the bill of exceptions.
Fourth: The Court erred in refusing to give the instructions prayed for by the defendants, as set forth in the bill of exceptions.
Fifth: The Court erred in instructing the jury that, on the evidence, they must find for th® plaintiff.
The first error assigned, involves the validity of the two special pleas. In one of these pleas, the appellant alleged that the bond was altered by the addition of his own name ; and the other, that it was altered by the addition of the name of Noah Thompson, and also of his. own; but he does not allege in either of them, that the alteration complained of, was made without his knowledge, license or consent. He was the last signer of the bond, and so far as the addition of his name produced any alteration therein, it could not, in the nature of things, have been done without his license and consent, unless his signature thereto was obtained by surprise, fraud or duress, neither of which is alleged or pretended. But it is.insisted by the counsel for the appellant, that he was not bound to make this allegation in his plea, because it being a negative one, he could not, (if alleged,) be required to prove it; and that he was only required to allege, what it would have been incumbent upon him, (if alleged,) to prove.
But it by no means follows, that because this allegation was of a negative character, it was not essential to the validity of his pleas ; or that if he had made the allegation, he would have been required to prove it. There are many negative allegations which must be alleged in pleading, which the party pleading them, is- not by law required. to prove. There is no difference, as to the rules of evidence, between criminal and civil cases ; what may be received in one, may be received in the other ; ‘and what is rejected in the one, ought to be rejected in the other. 2 Russell on Crimes, 588. The King vs. Watson, by Abbott Justice, 2 Starkie’s Reports, -155. And yet, in the case of The King vs. Hanson, where there had been a conviction for selling ale, without an excise license, the information negatived the defendants having a license-; but there was no evidence to support this averment; the only evidence to support the conviction being, that the defendant had, in fact, sold ale. The question was, whether the informer was bound to give evidence to negative the existence of a license. In support of the conviction, it was contended that such evidence was mnecessary, and that it lay upon the defendant to prove that he had a license ; for it is a rule, both of the civil and common law, that a man is not bound to prove a negative allegation; and the. case of the King ns. Turner, was cited, as an express authority upon the point. Abbott, Chief Justice, said: I am of opinion that the' conviction is right. It is a general rule that the proof of the affirmative lies upon the party who is to sustain it. In the ease of the King vs. Turner, all the learned Judges concurred in that principle. 2 Russell on Crimes, 693. 1 Hawkin’s PI. of the Crown, chap. 19, section 17. The"" United States vs. Hayward, 2 Gallison’s Reports, 499. Upon the same principle, a very late case, the Apothecary’s Company vs. Bently, was decided: “ That was an action for a penalty on the Statute of 55th George the Third, section 194, for practising as an Apothecary, without having obtained the certificate required by that act. All the counts in the declaration contained the allegation, that the defendant did act and practice as an Apothecary, &c., without having-obtained such certificate, as by the said act is directed. No- evidence was offered by. the plaintiffs to show that the defendant had not obtained the certificate. The plaintiffs having closed their case, the counsel for the defendant submitted that there must be a non-suit. Abbott, Chief Justice, said: “I am of opinion that the affirmative must be proved by the defendant.” . Ry. & Mood, N. P. C. 159, S. C. 1 Car & P.538. Spiere’s vs. Parker, 1 Term Rep. 144 — and Jelfs vs. Ballard, 1 Bossanquet & Puller, 468, are also authorities in point. A plea, alleging merely that seals were' affixed to a bond, without the consent of the defendant, without also alleging that it was done with the knowledge, or by the authority or direction of the plaintiff, is not sufficient. The United Stales, plaintiff in error, vs. William Linn, et al, defendants in error, 1 Howard’s S. C. Reports, 104 — 110. This last case is an authority directly in point, for neither of these! pleas contain any positive averment that the Union Bank, at the time when it is alleged that Noah Thompson and the defendant put their names to the instrument in question, had any interest in it, or authority over it; nor is there any averment in either of the pleas, that their names were so put, with the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff; all that is said in those pleas about the Union Bank, is said by way of inducement, rehearsal or argument. Everything, therefore, in relation to the Union Bank, is left to-inference merely; and it is a rule in pleading, that when a plea has on the face of it two intendments, it ought to be construed most strongly against the party who pleads it. To this point, the case last cited is also direct authority.
In the case of Speake and others vs. .the United States, 9 Cranch, .37, Mr. Justice Story, who delivered the opinion of the Court, said: “ It is clear at the common law, that an alteration or addition in a deed, as by adding a new obligor, or an erasure in the deed, as by striking out an old obligee, if done with the consent and concurrence of all the parties to the deed, does not avoid it; and this principle equally applies, whether the alteration or erasure be made in pursuance of an agreement and consent, - prior or subsequent to the execution of the deed; and the cases in the books, in which erasures, in-terlineations and alterations in deeds, have been held to avoid them, will be. found on examination to have been cases in which no such consent had been given.” The plea upon which this opinion was pronounced, contained the negative .allegation, that after the execution of the bond on-which the suit'was founded, it was .materially altered and changed, &c., (setting out the alteration,), without the license, consent or authority of-the defendant, &c. To which- the United States replied, that the bond was so altered and changed, with the assent, and by the concurrence, license, direction and authority of all the defendants. To this replication there was a demurrer, and joinder.in- demurrer, and upon-this issue the cause turned, Now, as the pleas under consideration, .do not contain either the allegation that the alteration complained of, was made without the consent of the defendant, or the allegation that it. was done with the knowledge,' or by the authority, or ■ direction of the plaintiff, we are warranted, in the conclusion, that it was done with the consent and concurrence of all the parties, upon, the principles above cited, “ that a plea which has upon the face of it two intendments, ought to be construed most strongly against the party who* pleads it; and if such were the case, surely they contain no matter of defence, and the Court below did not err in sustaining the demurrer to them. To the plea of Nil Debit, (which is. confined to the second count of the declaration,) there does not appear to have been any demurrer. '
The second error assigned, is that, “ the Court .erred in permitting the instrument of writing offered by the plaintiff, to be read in evidence.” ■ . •
One ground of exception relied upon in argument, was, that there was no scrawl or seal affixed to the signature of the appellant thereto, consequently it was not his deed, and therefore-’was variant from the one declared upon. There were five signers to this instrument, to the names of three of whom a scrawl was respectively affixed, as a seal — to the other, two there was no scrawl or seal affixed opposite to their respective names. But the appellant, by signing the instrü.ment, after those to whose names a-.scrawl was respectively affixed as a seal* and which, by our statute, is equivalent to a seal — (see the act to amend an act regulating judicial proceedings, approved 23d Nov. 1828, by the 36th .section of which it is provided, that “ a scrawl, -affixed as a seal, shall be as effectual as a seal; Duval’s Comp, page 96) — adopted the existing seal. .Two persons may make use of one seal in the execution of a bond, and it will be the deed of both. Flood vs. Yander, 1 Blackford’s Rep. 102. In Shepherd’s Touchstone, page 56, it is laid down that, “ if there be twenty to seal one deed, and they all seal with one seal, yet if they make distinct and separate prints! this is a sufficient sealing,, (as to all,) and the deed is good enough.' -
In the case of Lord Lovelace, Sir W. Jones, 268, it was admitted by the prosecution that, “ if one of the officers of the Forest put one seal to the rolls by consent of all the verderers, regarders, and other officers, it was as good as if every one had put his several seal; and if divers men enter into one obligation, and they all consent, and put but one seal to it, it is a good obligation of them all,” '■
It was held, in the case of Ball vs. -Demsterville, 4th Term Reps. 318, “ that if one partner in a transaction seal a deed with one seal, for.hitaself and partner, with his consent and in his presence, it is a good execution of the deed for both.” This is acknowledged to bé the rule in the case of Ludlow, et. al., vs. Simond, 2d Caine’s Cases, 1 — 42 and 55.
In the case of McKay, et. al., vs. Bloodgood, 9 John. Reps. 284, in debt on bond, it was held that, where one .partner sighs á bond in the name of the firm, and affixes one seal, it will bind the other who saw and approved it before the signing, and sealing, but who was not present when done. The principle of the two cases last cited is sustained by Philips on Evidence, page 416. .
But it was insisted in argument, on behalf, of the appellant, that to maké the' seal of one obligor the seal of another, it must appear by the instrument itself, that those who sign with that view, recognized the seal of the other party. If it be so, (and it is wnnecessary to the decision of this case to inquire into the soundness of this position,) the document before us concludes with these words : “ Witness our hands and seals.” . All who signed'it, therefore, recognized it as a sealed instrument. The case of Hatch vs. Crawford, Admr. 2 Porter, 54, is in point. It was an action of assumpsit upon a written agreement, which concluded as follows,’viz: Given under our hands and seals.” One signed and sealed, and immediately below his name, the other signed, but made no. separate seal. Plea, the general issue. .
The Court below excluded the instrument from-being read as evidence, under the issue in that form of action, on the ground that it was the deed of both. The Supreme Court of the State of Illinois, in the case of Davis vs. Burton and others, 3d Scammon’s Rep.. 44, which is cited and reaffirmed in the case of Wilcox vs. Ward, et. al., 3d. Scammon’s Reps. 51, said, that in reviewing the authorities upon the doctrines of seals, in questions the most analagous to the one before us, we see a steady and progiessive relaxation of the ancient and strict doctrine on this question. We find no ancient decision at common law precisely in point; but without such authority, we are disposed, (says the Court,) to lay down such a rule as will be consonant to reason and justice, and comport with the obvious intention of the parties. We recognize the principles assumed in this case, and feel, (to use the language of that Court,) warranted by common sense, by justice and sound reason, as well as the principles of law, to presume that all the signers of an instrument of writing, indicating upon its face an intention to seal it, adopted any seal or scrawl, which may have been affixed to the name of any one of them. If there is any country where the ancient and strict doctrine upon this question may, with propriety, be relaxed, it is our own, since the Legislative Council of the late Territory of Florida, by the 24th section of the act regulating judicial proceedings, above cited, which is of force in this State, has expressly enacted that: “ All promissory notes, and other instruments of writing, not under seal, shall have the same force and effect, as bonds and instruments under seal;” thereby rendering the difference between them rather matter of form than of substance.
The third error assigned is, that: “ The Court erred in rejecting the testimony of Henry L. Rutgers, as set fqrth in the bill of exceptions.
The defendant put in a plea of non est factum, upon which issue was joined, and this raises two questions; first, whether the instrument declared upon is, or is not his bond; and second, whether if it is his deed, he is not estopped from saying in this suit, that it is not the bond of all who signed it. What the effect may be as to the rights of the parties who signed the bond before him, and at a different time, (if any of them did thus sign it,) we are not called upon now to enquire or decide ; that it is good as to him we entertain no doubt. He had a right to sign it at the time and under the circumstances that he did so, or at least he cannot have any right to set up his own act in this regard, to avoid his own deed. In this opinion we are borne out by the case ofthe The United States vs. Linn et al before cited, which was an action of debt instituted upon the official bond of a Receiver of Public monies. Upon the trial of that cause, after reading the bond to the jury, the defendant called a witness who testified in substance that he saw the bond after it had been signed by the obligors in the hands of William Linn, (the obligor first named therein,) after it had been returned from the District Judge, with his certificate endorsed of the sufficiency of the sureties. That the District Judge, in a' note in writing accompanying the bond, pointed out the omission of the seals to the names of the signers of the instrument, and said Linn, saying he would obviate that difficulty, took a pen, and in the presence of the witnesses, added scrawls by way of seals to each name subscribed as makers of the instrument. All the defendants united in a joint plea of “ non est factum,” and the Court held that the adding of the scrawl by Linn, to his own name, did not vitiate the instrument as to him; that he had a right to add the seal, or at least he could have no right to set up his own act in this respect to avoid his own deed. It was therefore his deed, and the plea “ non est factum,” as to him was false, and the Court sustained the demurrer to it, upon the familiar principle, that a joint plea, which is false as to one, is false as to all the parties pleading it.
By the 34th section of the act “ regulating judicial proceedings, before referred to, Duvals Com. p. 96 ; it is (in substance) declared “ that the assignment or endorsement of any bond, note, covenant, deed, bill of exchange, or other writing, whereby money is promised, or secured to be paid, shall vest the assignee or endorsee thereof, with the same rights, powers and capacities, as might have been possessed by the assignor or endorser ; and the assignee or endorsee, may bring suit in his own name; nor shall it be necessary for the as-signee or endorsee of any instrument assignable by law, to set forth in his declaration the consideration upon which such assignment was made, nor to prove such consideration,1 unless the same shall be impeached by the defendant, under oath.”
It is not supposed that the object of this provision was to place these several classes of instruments, upon a footing (in all respects) with commercial paper, yet the effect of it is to make them negocia-ble by assignment or endorsement. If this were a new Statute, this Court would be inclined to confine the word assignment in.the section last cited to such instruments as at common law did not pass. by endorsement, and to extend the word endorsement only to other classes of written instruments ; but the provision is a convenient one as generally understood and acted upon. The practice of applying it alike to all tjiese various classes of instruments, has long prevailed in the ordinary transactions of business, and we are not now disposed to disturb it. The present holder of this instrument is an endorsee, and brought this suit as such under that act. “ There is not upon the face of the instrument any thing indicating an alteration, or casting a suspicion upon its validity, that should have put the appellee upon enquiry.” He took it, for aught that appears, in good faith. The appellant, by putting- his name thereto, gave value to the instrument ; “ non constat,” but the appellee took it upon the faith and credit of his name alone. The testimony of Henry L. Rutgers, if it could have been received, would show that this is the very instrument which the appellant intended to execute; and we think' that under all these circumstances he is estopped from setting up his own act in regard to this alleged'alteration, even to avoid this suit.
The rule, said Lord Denman, in delivering the judgment of the Court in the case of Pickard vs.' Sears, 6 Adolphus and Ellis, 475, is, that where one by his words or conduct,, wilfully causes another to believe in the existence of a certain State of things, and induces him to act on that belief so as to alter his own previous position, the former is concluded from averring against the latter a different state of things existing at the same time ; and this principle is affirmed, also, in the cases of Coles vs. The Bank of England, 10 Adolphus & Ellis, 439. Hearne vs. Rogers, 9 B. & C, 586. Groves vs. Key, 3 B. & Ad. 144.
No man can avoid his own deed by which an estate has passed, on account of his own fraud in executing it. Doe ex dem Roberts vs. Roberts, 2 Barnwell & Alderson, Rep. 367. He is estopped from so doing. “ Contrary to the feeling which appears to have pervaded the Courts with regard to other classes of estoppels, their inclination seems to have been to extend the list of estoppels in pais, especially in mercantile transactions, where men are obliged to trust much to appearances. Jenys vs. Fowler, Strange Rep. 946. These authorities are directly in point, for notwithstanding the instrument in question is not strictly mercantile paper, yet it is in the nature (to a certain extent) of such paper. The act referred to makes it nego-ciable. In déaling in it, men are obliged to trust much to appearances. It requires amongst those who deal in it, the utmost fairness and good faith, and the principles deducible from the cases last cited are deemed applicable to it, and the question before us. ■
If we are right in the views which we have taken of these matters, (and we entertain no doubt about them,) neither the third, fourth, or fifth errors are well assigned.
There was another point taken for the appellant, upon the argument of this cause, which deserves a passing notice. It was that the assignment should have been under seal. The remarks heretofore made, respecting the 34th section of our judiciary act, aiid its bearing upon this class of casés, would seem to be a sufficient answer to that position. But lest it may not be so considered, we refer to the case of Clark vs. Rogers, 2 Greenleaf’s Rep. 148 ; in which Chief Justice Mellen, in delivering the opinion of the Court, remarked, that “ for many years, Courts of Justice have been gradually becoming more and more inclined to protect equitable interests. Less form is necessary now than formerly as to the mode of creating such an interest. The object is to ascertain that it is an interest founded in equity and justice, and on good and adequate consideration,” and for the correctness of that opinion, he cites Perkins vs. Parker, 1 Mass. Rep. 123. Dix vs. Cobb, 4 Mass. Rep. 508. Brown vs. Maine Bank, 11 Mass. Rep. 153. Quiner vs. Marblehead Insurance Company, 10 Mass. Rep. 482. Mowry vs. Todd, 12 Mass. Rep. 281. Jones vs. Witter, 13 Mass. Rep. 304, and particularly Dunn vs. Snell, 15 Mass. Rep. 481, (which very fully sustain the position assumed,) and in the case of Vose vs. Handy, 2 Greenleaf’s Rep. 334, he repeats the remark; again cities the same authorities, and , adds, that the Chief Justice in the case of Jones vs. Witter, (above cited) says, “ there are cases in the old books, which show that debts, and even deeds, may be assigned by parol, and we are satisfied, (he says) that there is no sensible ground upon which a writing shall be held necessary to prove an assignment of a contract, which assignment has been executed by delivery, any more than in the assignment of a personal chattel.
In the case of Jones vs. Snell, the Court went still further, and decided that the mere delivery over of ,an execution, was an assignment of it, and of the judgment. And in the case of Prescott vs. Hall, 17 John Rep. 284 ; Spencer Chief Justice, delivering the opinion of the Court, and speaking of the validity of assignments,- says* “ I do not consider the want of a seal essential, the mere delivery of the chose in action would be sufficient, even were it a specialty,” and we fully concur in this view of the law.
The'assignment of the bond in this case was in writing, and, by virtue of the státute referred to, vests in the appellee the legal interest. The consideration is not denied. He was authorized to institute this suit (as he has done,) in-his own name. The proofs sustain it. The errors are not well taken.
The Judgment of the Court below is affirmed with costs.

"Noah Thompson vs. Robert W. Williams, Trustee, &c.",1 Fla. 56,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Dougias, Chief Justice:
This is an action of debt, instituted by Robert W. Williams, Trustee, &c.; against Noah Thompson, .in the Superior Court of Leon County, in the Middle District of Florida, upon four several single bills, or writings obligatory. The declaration contains five counts, one upon each of the bills of writings obligatory, and one upon account stated; a copy of each of the said bills, or writings obligatory, is annexed to the declaration. The pleas are, first Nil Debet; and after oyer upon the said bills or writings obligatory, second, “ non est factum.” Third, a special plea, — ailedging in substance, that he the said defendant, did not make or sign, seal or deliver the said writings obligatory, in the said declaration, mentioned as to each note respectively, either jointly or severally, or at the days, and times specified; nor did the said Nattall, Braden & Craig, en-dorsee, order, deliver or assign the said supposed writing obligatory to plaintiff, on the days and times specified in the declaration, but the said, other parties supposed; made the said supposed writings obligatory on the days and times specified ; and the said Nuttall,"" Braden & Craig, transferred the same to the Union Bank of Florida, to wit: on the days and years in the declaration mentioned; and that said William B. Nuttall, afterwards, to wit: on the twenty ninth day of April, in the year 1837, in the County of Jefferson, departed this life; and this defendant after the death of Nuttall, to wit: on the 21st day of November, in the year last aforesaid at Leon County, aforesaid, signed, and sealed the said supposed writing obligatory in possession of said Union Bank of Florida, then and there being, and to the said Union Bank of Florida, then and there belonging, by virtue of said endorsement, and so the said defendent says, that said several, supposed writings obligatory are not his deeds, and this he is ready to verify, wherefore, &c.
To the first and second pleas the plaintiff joined issue, but demurred specially to the third, “because it amounts’to general issue, and is uncertain, informal and insufficient. The defendant put in a join-der to the demurrer. The Court, after argument, sustained the demurrer, and the cause was afterwards submitted to a jury upon the two issues of fact above set forth, who returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, for the sum of fifteen thousand two hundred and fifty-two 30-100 dollars, to be discharged by the payment of ten thousand one hundred and five 92-100 dollars; for which last sum and costs, judgment was entered. ,
On the trial, the plaintiff offered in' evidence the original bonds (or bills,) and proved the hand writing of Nuttall, Braden and Craig, in the endorsement of the original bonds, and the hand writing of John R. Dorsey, John S. Taylor^ John Taylor and H. B. Bradford, only.
And defendant objected to the introduction of said papers in testimony, as variant from the copies of bonds filed and declared upon, but the Court overruled the objection and admitted, said papers in evidence to which opinion defendant excepted. The defendant, then offered Hector W. Braden, a competent witness of lawful age, one of the endorsers of the bonds or writings obligatory, who proved that he delivered all the writings obligatory offered in evidence to the Union Bank after the death of William B. Nuttall, and that when he so delivered them, neither the signature or seal of Noah Thompson was upon them. Whereupon the defendants counsel objected to the bonds being received in evidence, on the ground, that the declaration alleged a direct assignment and transfer of a joint and several bond made by defendant, and the other parties respectively to Nuttall, Braden and Craig, and transferred, and assigned by those persons then and there, (in Nuttalls life time,) to the plaintiff; and the testimony proved that the bonds introduced were signed and sealed by the other parties without the defendant, and assigned after Nuttall’s death to the Union Bank, and then signed by defendant; and there was no evidence of transfer to Robert W. Williams ; but the Court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence, to which defendant by counsel excepted.
And the defendant by his counsel then moved the Court to instruct the jury:
First, That the .mere endorsement in Nuttall’s lifetime, without delivery, gave no title as to Nuttall, and does not sustain the allegations in the declaration of assignment to Williams.
Secondly, That the signature of Thompson, of the bonds in the hands of the bank, could not make it a joint and several bond as declared upon.
Thirdly, That the bonds having been declared upon as joint and several bonds, they must be proved to be joint and several with all parties, before the plaintiff can recover in this action.
Fourthly, That there being no seal to the name of Thompson and some others, on several of the bonds which are declared upon as sealed with their seals, is a fatal variance as to all those bonds.
The Court refused all of said instructions except the third, which was granted, but with an instruction and opinion, that the signature of the bonds in the hands of the bank, related back to the original signing, and made the bond joint, and as well as several. To which several refusals, opinions and instructions, the defendant by his counsel excepted, and prayed that this his bill of exceptions might be signed and sealed by the Court,, which was done.
(And signed) S. J. DOUGLAS, Judge, [seal.]
The defendant prayed an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the late Territory of Florida ; the case was carried up to that Court, and was transferred to this Court under the provisions contained in the last clause of the schedule and ordinance of the Constitution of the State, and in the 14th section of the act of the General Assembly, “ to organize the Supreme Court of the .State of Florida,” approved, July 25th, 1845.
A motion was made on the first day of the present term by. the counsel for the appellee to dismiss this suit upon the following grounds, viz:
First, Because it has no rightful place in this Court, and this Court has no jurisdiction of the same, no' appeal or writ of error having been sued out or taken to this Court, and this Court has no appellate jurisdiction of the cause.
Second, Because the judgment of. the Leon Superior Court is final, until reversed by the proper appellate tribunal, constituted by the acts of Congress of the United States.
Third, Because this Court has appellate jurisdiction only over those inferior Courts, which the constitution of the State of Florida has established, and which compose with this Court the judiciary power of the Statewhich motion was overruled for the reasons stated by the Court, in an opinion delivered by Judge Baltzell, upon a former day of this term, upon a similár motion founded upon the same grounds in the case of Charles D. Stewart vs. Thomas Preston, Junior; it is therefore unnecessary for us to do more now on this subject than to refer to that opinion.
The appellant has filed herein the following errors :
First, The Court erred in refusing the first, second and fourth instructions asked by defendant below.
Second, The Court erred in instructing the jury that the signature of the bonds in the hands of the bank, related back to the original signing, and made the bond joint as well as several.
Third, The Court erred in overruling the objections of defendant below, to the introduction of the bonds as testimony on the ground of variance between the declaration and proof.
Fourth, The Court erred in admitting the bonds as testimony, when the proof showed they were void as to all the obligors.
Fifth, The Court erred in admitting the bonds as testimony, when the proof showed that they had never been fully executed by defendant below. i
No objection was made to the introduction of the bond as evidence, on account of the want of proof of the signatures of any of the obli-gors. Nor has any exception been taken, or error assigned, on account of the ruling of the Court upon the special plea, which seems to have been abandoned, as well it might, for it is clearly bad. . It contains no allegation that tends to shew that the signing of the instrument in question, by the appellant, Thompson, was not done with the knowledge and consent of all the parties interested in it, at the time when this act was^done ; and if it were so done, it would not have affected its validity; and in the absence of any allegation, or even attempt to prove the contrary, we are warranted in presuming that it was so done. It is not alledged, nor was any proof offered, (so far as the record shows,) to prove that the Union Bank of Florida, or any of its officers, or any one of the parties interested in any one of these several instruments, had any agency in causing the name of the defendant to be put thereto, or that any one of them had any knowledge of the matter; nor is there any allegation, nor does it appear that any proof was offered to show, that the signature of the defendant, to these several bonds, or single bills, or to any one of them, was obtained by surprise, fraud or duress, or that he did not sign each and every one of them, freely and voluntarily, and íor a good consideration. None of the pleas filed in this case were sworn to; the plaintiff, therefore, was not required to prove the consideration of the bonds, or of the endorsement or assignment thereof.
The special plea alledges that, the other parties made the said supposed writings obligatory, on the days and times specified in the declaration, and that the defendant afterwards signed and sealed the said supposed writings obligatory, in possession of the said Union Bank of Florida, then and there being, and to the said Union Bank of Florida then and there belonging. They might have been in 'the possession of, and belonged to the said Union Bank .of Florida, at the time when the defendant signed them, yet that Bank might, or any of its officers might not, have known of his signing these bonds ; and in the total absence of allegation, or proof, or offer of. proof to the contrary, we may presume that they had not. But the more reasonable and fair presumption is, that they did know of it, and assent to it, and that it was done with the full knowledge of all the parties interested in them.
In the bill of exceptions of the defendant, which makes a part of the record of this cause, it appears, that he objected to these bonds being received in evidence, on the ground that, the declaration al-ledged a direct assignment and transfer of a joint and several bond, made by defendant and other parties respectively, to Nuttall, Braden <&r Craig, and transferred and assigned by those persons, then and there, (in Nuttall’s life time,) to the plaintiff; when the testimony proved that the bonds introduced were signed and sealed by the other parties, without the defendant, and assigned after Nuttall’s death to the Union Bank, and then signed by defendant. If this were so, (and we cannot presume it to have been otherwise, against his own express allegation, and the testimony of the witness, Braden,) then the appellant, Thompson, was the last signer of each and all of these several bonds, or writings obligatory. Indeed, it appears upon the face of them, that'his name is the last upón all of them, except one. And if he was the last' signer of them, (as he appears from his own shewing to have been,) then this case, in all its aspects and bearings, is in principle, the same as that of Frederick R. Gotten, appellant, vs. Robert W. Williams, appellee, decided at the present term of this Court, and must share alike fate. We can see ho essential difference between them. Every important question which comes up for decision in the case before us, arose, and were all very fully discuss, ed in that case. We have re-examined and re-considered them in this, and do not perceive any cause to change the opinion therein delivered upon these several points, and therefore deem it unnecessary to enter upon a more elaborate discussion of them now, hut refer to the opinion pronounced in that case, and the authorities therein referred to, as conclusive upon this.
The judgment of the Court below must be affirmed, with costs.
P&r totam curiam."
"Eli Horn & Jeremiah Savell, Executors of Joab Horn, deceased, vs. David Gartman",1 Fla. 63,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baltzell, Justice:
The right of recovery of Gartman, the plaintiff, in the Court below, depends upon the legal effect and construction of an instrument of writing, in these words :
TERRITORY 03? FLORIDA, > Walton County. \
Know all men by these presents, that I, Joab Horn, of the Territory and county aforesaid, being in sound mind and perfect memory, are mindful this day to make a distribution of my property to my different children, to wit: David Gartman ; that for the natural love and affection which I bear towards him, and my deceased daughter, Drucilla, and the heirs of her body. In the presence of witnesses, do this day bequeath, covenant, and positively deed, a certain portion of my property, to wit: .a negro man, named Will, and wife Milly, and seven cows and calves ; to which species of property, I, the said Joab Horn, have at this time in possession, and owner of, clear of any enthrallment; and is to remain undivided, and in my possession, so long as I live — and after my death, immediately the stipulated properly in this deed composed, to be bona fide the property of David Gartman, with its increase, to have and to hold for-ever and forever.
In witness whereunto I have set my hand and seal, this 29th of June, 1829.
1iis
JOAB X HORN, [seal] marie.
And in the presents of,
Jeeemiah Saveli.,
Reuben N. Baeeow,
Richaed J. Compton.
Appellants, the executors of Horn, contend that this instrument confers no right:
1st. Because there was no delivery of the property, nor a sufficient delivery in law, of the deed.
2d. Because a remainder is created after a life estate, which is not permitted by law, except in cases of trust, and by will.
3d. Because the instrument is testamentary, and was revoked by the will of Joab Horn, made afterwards.
A delivery of the property was not made — indeed, was inconsistent with the terms of the instrument. The inquiry then arises, does a deed dispense with delivery, and is it sufficient to convey the property, without a transfer of the possession. The law, in this respect, seems to be well settled — it being held, “ that in order to transfer property by gift, there must be either a deed, or instrument of gift, or there must be an actual delivery of the thing to the donee.” 2 Barn. & Ald. 552. Adams vs. Hays, 2 Iredell, R. 366. 2 Kent’s Com. 438. 2 John, 52. 2 Leigh, 340. 2 Black, 441.
If valid as a deed, a second objection is, that there was no delivery of it. The instructions asked by defendant, shew that the deed was “ presented by the plaintiff, to the recording officer, for registration,” and was recorded. Consequently, it- must have been in plaintiff’s possession. This is sufficient evidence of delivery. Gilbert vs. Dunns lessee, 14 Peters, 322.
Nor does the fact of its being produced at the trial, by the defendants, under notice, alter the case. Brown vs. Winthrop, 1 John. Chy. 329—256. Ingraham vs. Porter, 4 McCord, 198. Dawson vs. Dawson, Rice’s Eq. R. 257.
The next point is, that a remainder in personal property cannot be created after a life estate, according to law.
“ By the ancient common law, personal estate was little regarded, “ and thought to be subject to no modifications or limitations what- “ ever. A gift or grant of a personal thing, for a day, or even for “ an hour, was supposed to be equivalent to a gift, or grant of it “forever.” Shep. Touch. 116. “Butin succeeding ages, when “ commerce and civilization had given additional importance to per- “ sonal estate, new rules were introduced, to make it answer better “ the exigencies of society; and it was at length placed, with respect “ to the limitations of which it was susceptible, more upon an equality “ with real estate. In England, the only difference is, that real es- “ tate may be entailed, and personal cannot; and in this country, “ where estates tail are abolished, the rule is exactly the same with “ respect to real and personal estate.” This was the case of a gift of slaves, to take effect after the death of grantor and wife, reserving a life estate — presenting the very point at issue in this case. Boyle Ch. Just. in Banks vs. Marksbury, 3 Littell R. 276.
In Smith vs. Bell, although it was the case of a will, yet the remarks of Chief Justice Marshall are pertinent to the present case. “ The rule that a remainder may be limited, after a life estate in “ personal property, is as well settled as any other principle of our “ law. The attempt to create such limitation is not opposed by the “ policy' of the law, or any of its rules.” 6 Peters R. 78.
In North Carolina, the modern rule was first adopted. 1 Haywood, 234. 1 Murphy, 466. Afterwards the old common law rule was declared to be in force, the Judges expressing their regret in the cases decided by them, “ that a disposition of property, so just and simple in itself, could not be sustained.” Foscue vs. Foscue, 3 Hawks R. 544.
“I think it a hard case,” says Judge Hall, “ that this species of property cannot be conveyed, in a mode apparently so simple, when the reason upon which the rule was originally founded, is no more; and cannot but regret, that decisions upon the subject had not been more comformable to the nature of this kind of property, and the convenience of those who possessed it. Graham vs. Graham, 2 Hawks, 322.
In 1823, the Legislature altered the law as thus declared.
In S. Carolina, the Chancellor, in a case affirmed by the Court of Appeals, in 1839, says: “ I shall not, after the decisions which have been made in this State, trouble myself by inquiring, whether a personal vested interest, to be enjoyed in future, can be directly conveyed by deed, either as to realty or personalty ; that is a settled question.” Dawson vs. Dawson, Rice’s Eq. R. 261.
In Carnes and wife vs. Marley, the deed was: “ I give to H. Jones, to hold to him, and his executors forever; provided, that I resume the possession, use and labor of said slaves, for and during my natural life.” The cause was before the Court of Appeals of Tennessee, in 1827, when the Court decided the gift invalid. The opinion, however, was not satisfactory, and a re-argument was granted. The case was again argued in 1830, and held under advisement until August, 1831. The Court then say: ‘‘Nothing is better settled than that, an interest in remainder, after an interest for life expires, may be limited in a deed for slaves. 2 Yerger,.584.
But it is needless to multiply cases, when authority is so abundant, and the question has been so ably decided. 2 Kent Com. 352. Johnson vs. Mitchell, 1 Humphrey, 173. 2 Black, 398. 7 Harris & Johnson, 257—272. 1 Henry Black, 535. 1 Murphy, 466.
The case of Thompson vs. Thompson, &c., has been cited as asserting a contrary doctrine. That was the case of an instrument not under seal, so that the point was not before the Court for decision. 2 How. Miss. R. 737.
The case in 12 New Hamp. R. is also relied on by appellants. It was the case of a deed not delivered to grantees, and in which the party claiming the benefit of it, conceded that it could not avail him as a deed. The question before the Court seemed to be rather as to the effect of subsequent arrangements between the parties, in revoking the deed. 12 New Hamp. 872.
We are of opinion then, that a remainder may be created in personal property, after a life estate, by deed.
The third position is, that the instrument is testamentary in its character — a question of some novelty in our Courts, and of no little difficulty.
If Mr. Horn intended the instrument of 29th June, 1829, to operate as a deed, and it is not legally impossible that it shall so operate, his intention should prevail. “ It is a benign principle, well established,” says Chancellor Johnson, in a case confirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals of South Carolina, “ that if a paper, wearing the “ form of a deed, cannot operate as a deed, it shall, (if that will not “ prevent its provisions,) be allowed as a testament.” Dawson vs. Dawson, Rice’s Eq. R. 260. 4 Dessausure, 617.
So in Williams on Executors: “ It is settled law, that if the paper contains a disposition of property, to be made after death, though meant as a deed of gift or bond, and not intended as a will, yet, if it cannot operate in the latter, it may nevertheless, in the former character.” 1 Williams ex’rs, 55. 2 Haggard, 247.
“ If the instrument is to be consummated only by death, and not .operate during life ; especially if it is not upon a stamp — contains no valuable consideration — is not delivered out' of the custody of the maker, and comprises no beneficial dispositions, but such as are ulterior to the death of the donor; in short, if death is the event which is to give life and operation to the instrument, the Court will grant probate of it as a will.” Lovelass on Wills, 317.
“ In respect to personal property, where there is a final intention proved and execution prevented by the act of God, the mere want of execution does not invalidate the instrument. The disposition intended to be made, has the same legal effect in regard to personal property as if the instrrments had been actually signed and attested. It is also settled law, and several cases have been decided, that if the paper contains the disposition of the property to be made after death, though it were meant to operate as a settlement or a deed of gift, or a bond, though such paper were not intended to he a will, nor other testamentary instrument, hut an instrument of a different shape, yet, if it cannot operate in the latter, it may nevertheless operate in the former character.” 2 Haggard, 108-235.
These authorties are quoted without reference to the effect of our statute on the subject of Wills, which it is not necessary here to notice.
The question then is, can this paper' be sustained, and operate as a good and valid deed ? The rules for the transfer of real estate have long since been established, and their meaning, force and effect declared and well understood. We are not aware that any such exist, or have been prescribed as to personal property. Undoubtedly less form is required to transfer personalty; such property ordinarily is passed by mere delivery. The most that the authorities seem to require, is, that there be an actual gift — a design consummated — not the mere intention to give. In the case in 2 Yerger above cited, the words used were “ I give,” and the deed was held sufficient; In the case of Dawson vs. Dawson, the deed was in these terms, “ this day I Richard Dawson, do give to my named children in my will, all my real estate, and all my personal property, and goods and chattels to my named children in my will, and I do acknowledge this day, to be theirn, and no others than those named in my will, and the use therein menshened.” This, also, was established as a valid deed, coupled with the will so as to make the instrument take effect in futuro.
In Grangive vs. Arden, the holder of a lottery ticket wrote the name of his daughter on it and put it in his desk, afterwards said “ the ticket was hersit did not belong to him, he had given it to his daughter, &c.
“ These declarations, say the Court, recognize a gift as having been made. They afforded reasonable ground for a jury to infer that all the formality necessary to a valid gift had been complied with.” 10 John, 296.
In the case of Johnson vs. Mitchell the words were, “ I agree to throw into the hands of my sons-in-law.” The Court say, “ that these words however unusual and inartificial, want the force and efficacy of the words, give or transfer, &c., it would be difficult to maintain,” &c. 1 Humph. 173.
“In the construction of deeds the Court will lean towards giving validity to a deed. If it will not have an operation one way, it may operate in some other way.” Chase, Justice, 1 Harris &; John, 527.
i( There is one general-principle that runs through the construction of deeds, that they are to be'construed most beneficially for the party to whom they are made ; and 2ndly, that a deed shall never be void, when the words may be applied to any intent to make it good.” 1 Plow. 159.
It is true, that the instrument under consideration has some of the terms peculiar to wills, “ being in sound mind and body, are mindful this day to make distribution, do bequeath;” yet the remainder of it has terms and provisions not contained in a will, but peculiar to a deed, showing an evident purpose to convey, a design executed, something done, in fact a deed. It does not commence as a will, but in the form of a bill of sale, “ know, all men by these presents;” it contains a consideration. The words, “ do this day covenant,” import agreement, bargain and obligation; “ positively deed,” a certainty of transfer, a determination and purpose evidenced by use of a word in common acceptation, the most solemn and effectual, that is known among men. The reservation of a life estate especially would be absurd in a Will. It is entitled as a “ deed of gift to David Gartman” by the person who drew it, and the probate by Compton, one of the witnesses, before Jeremiah Saveli a Justice of the Peace, who is also a witness and a defendant in the case, states, “ that the within deed was fairly assigned and delivered in his presents.”
It is a striking feature of this case, that the object in construing this instrument a testament, is to effect its destruction, whereas the benign principle of construing deeds, &c., as wills, was designed for their preservation. If the instrument were defective as a deed, the argument might be more effectual under the authorities to sustain it as a will.
It has been insisted in this Court, that the deed was invalid, for want of a consideration, Gartman being only the son-in-law of Horn. This point was not presented in the Court below, from any thing appearing in the record ; and after a verdict we should be inclined to regard the case of plaintiff as made out except as to the objections raised by the bill of exceptions. The position however is not sustained by the authorities. Voluntary agreements in favor of strangers are sustained, and “ with respect to chattel interests, an agreement under seal imports a consideration at law.” 3 Burrow, 670. 7 T. R. 350. Beard vs. Mitchell, 1 Vern, 42. 3 P. Wms. 222. Brown vs. Winthrop, 1 John ch. 336. 4 Com. Dig. 266, Fait B. 4 b.
Delivery of this slave to Gartman would have been good by way of gift, and if a deed supplies the place of, and is a substitute for delivery, there would seem to be no objection to the want of a consideration.
One of the errors assigned is that the deposition of Jeremiah Saveli one of the defendants and executor of the will of Joab Horn, was offered in evidence, but rejected by the Court. The deposition is not a part of the record, nor does the bill of exceptions state what was designed to be proved by it, or the ground on which it was rejected. Under these circumstances, we cannot say whether the decision was right or wrong. We cannot take it for granted that the objection was because he was executor. It may have been that his testimony was not materia], and this is in accordance with the ground invariably acted upon by Appellate Courts, that every fair intendment is to be made in support of the judgment below. The office of a- bill of exceptions is to give the facts on which the Courts decided, and it should give all the facts bearing upon the decision, so that the Appellate Court, may know fully and clearly every thing which influenced the decision of the Court, After a statement of these facts it may then be stated, that the Court instructed the jury, or decided in such manner upon the facts so stated.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that there is no error in the instructions given in the Court below, and that the judgment be affirmed.
The original deed produced in this Court will be delivered to ap-pellee’s attorney, to be filed in the Court below."
The State vs. Richard K. Call,1 Fla. 92,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Hawkins, Justice:
This case comes before the Court on bill of exceptions, signed by Samuel J. Douglas, late Judge of the Superior Court of the Ter- •• sritory, stating the instructions he had gjven to the jury on the trial before him, and concluding as follows, “to which,instructions given by the Court, the defendant’s counsel excepted, and the Court- being desirous that the same might be heard before the- Court of Appeals of , this Territory, has signed and sealed this bill of exceptions.”
The first question presented by the record for the consideration of the Court is, have they jurisdiction of the case.
The act of the Territorial Legislature passed in 1833, gave- the benefit of an appeal or writ of- erior to the Court- of Appeals of the Territory, front} all final judgments and sentences'of the Courts of the Territory. Acts 1833,-page 113.» . . ,
This law was expressly repealed by an act passed in 1841, declaring, that from and after the passage of this act, no appeal or writ of error, or bill of exceptions to evidence; should be entertained or allowed, or granted to a defendant, or defendants, in criminal prosecutions in any of the Courts of this Territory; but if in, the trial of any criminal prosecution, the Judge before whom the same is tried, shall entertain a doubt upon any legal question, arising in the case, then and in that case, the said Judge may continue the same, and shall as soon as convenient make a statement in writing.of the question of law, and carry up or transmit the same^ peals for its consideration and decision. Ac*
- Tiie design of the Legislature is too clearli expressed : to occasion a doubt as to their intention.
The' certificate of the Judge neither state but expresses-, merely a desire to have the Court of Appeals. If the Legislature desig a -case, they have not so declared it.
A question of this kind arose before the Court of Appeals of the State.of ^Mississippi, in which the following view was taken: “It is a general rule, that the Appellate Court can act only on the record from the Inferior Court, which must contain a case sufficiently certain in its character to enable this Court to act upon it Admitting that the powers of this Court are co-extensive with those possessed by the former Supreme Court, the doubts of the'Judge below, if any existed, being all that could give jurisdiction, are not properly certified'to this Court. It should clearly appear by the record, that the Judge entertained doubts as to the rule of decision, and for this reason, that he had adjourned the question on which he doubted, to this Court for its,decision.” Caraway vs. Board, Police, Yazoo County, 1 Howard, 22.
The case ought rightly to have been presented to the Court, of Appeals of the Territory at' its last se'ssion, and the Judge of the Circuit Court finding it in the Court below, with the certificate of the Judge, did rightlyin having the papers transmitted to.this Court for its action. The Court having no jurisdiction of it, will have it remanded to the Circuit Court of the County, -where it was tried.
It is therefore considered by the Cpurt, that this cage be dismissed from the docket,;-and the papers be-remitted to the Circuit 'Court for the County of Wakulla, for further proceedings to be had therein, agreeably to law."
Thomas U. White vs. John G. Camp,1 Fla. 94,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Hawkins, Justice:
The action in the Court below is of assumpsit, by Thomas U. White, the plaintiff in error, endorsee, against John G. Camp, maker of the following promissory note:
“$127 97-100. Sandusky City, Sept. 6, 1839.
“ Due on demand to William T. Reese or order, for value receiv- “ ed, one hundred and twenty-seven 97-100 dollars.
“ JOHN G. CAMP.
(Endorsed) — “ W. T. Reese.”'
The declaration contains a count upon the note, money counts, and account stated.
The defendant, Camp, put in three pleas: 1st, Non assumpsits 2d, That the promissory note sued upon was given and made without any lawful or valuable consideration, and was obtained by the payee, Reese, by fraud, misrepresentation, concealment, covin, and deceit, and that the said note was, and is void, &c. 3d, That the
endorsement or assignment of the note was made without any lawful or valuable consideration, and in fraud of the rights and interest of the defendant, to deceiv.e and defraud him in the premises.
Accompanying the pleas, there was a notice to plaintiff that, under the general issue pleaded, the defendant would prove that said William T. Reese, one Thomas Neill, Isaac A. Mills, and defendant, owned as tenants in common, a certain tract of land in Sandusky, Erie county, in the State of Ohio, and attempted to make division of said lands; and said note was given for the supposed difference due siaid'Reese in said division; that since then, one Owen Follet, of whom said Reese purchased, has instituted proceedings to get said Reese’s share of land, said Reese never having paid him the purchase money ; and that the attempted division of said land, on which said note was predicated, is nullified and voif, in consequence thereof; and that the same was, therefore, given without any consideration; or if there was any consideration, it has totally failed. That said Reese had since been declared a bankrupt; that the endorsement of the note to plaintiff was fraudulently made, by collusion, with knowledge and notice by plaintiff of the facts as before stated ; that Reese was largely indebted to him, the'defendant, at the time of the transfer of the note, and before, for defendant’s blank endorsements, given to him for specified purposes, which Reese did not comply with, but made use of the s.ame, by getting them discounted, and misapplied the proceeds, not as he engaged appropriating it, to pay for said land to Follet, and so release it, so as to effectuate said division; all of which the defendant alledges plaintiff had notice of, and that defendant would rely on said facts, in bar of the action..
Appended to this notice was an affidavit, in which the defendant denies, on oath, the consideration of said note declared on ,• and also saith, that if the consideration was legal and valid, the same has to-tally failed. He further denies, on oath, the consideration of said assignment or endorsement of the note, and that he believed the facts, as set fotth in the notice, are true.
The plaintiff replied by similiter to the first plea, and takes issue' on the second and third.
The parties waived a trial by jury, and put themselves upon the judgment of the Court. By the bill of exceptions, it is shown, that the plaintiff offered in evidence in support of his declaration the note sued upon, and satisfactorily proved the signature of the endorser, Reese; and thereupon.Camp, the defendant, after exhibiting his affidavit, made under the statute-, asked the Court to determine Upon the pleadings, that- the plaintiff to recover must prove the consideration for which the .note was given by Camp to Reese, under the second ploa,.and notice of special matter; and under the third plea and notice as aforesaid, must prove the consideration'of the assignment or endorsement by Reese to plaintiff; and the Court so determined; and'gave judgment accordingly for defendant. , ,
To that opinion the plaintiff excepted; .and thereupon a writ of error issued. * . .
The counsel for the plaintiff in error assigns the following errors; ‘First. The Court erred in determining that, upon the second plea, and affidavit, and notice, it was'necessary for the .plaintiff to prove the consideration of the note,-before hecquld recover. ,
Second-. The Court erreft in determining,- that up.on .third plea, affidavit and notice, it was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove consideration of the endorsement or assignment, from Reese to him.
Third. That upon the pleadings and.evidence in the cause; plaintiff was entitled to judgment.
The defendant, in the Court below, lias attempted to avail himself of the provisions of the statutes of Florida, as to the proof of the-execution and consideration of bonds, bills, notes, et. ceterct, contained in the twenty-fourth and thirty-fourth sections of the act, in relation to judicial proceedings, passed November 23d; 1829., Dhval’s Compi-lador 95 and' 96. <
Section-24, after stating that all promissory notes, and other writings, not under seal, shall’have the same force and effect as bonds and instruments under seal, says that s It “ shall not be necessary “ for the plaintiff to prove the execution of any bond, note, or 'other “ instrument of writing, purporting to have’ been, signed by the defendant, nor the consideration for1 which the same was given, un- “ less the same shall be denied by plea, put in and filed as aforesaid, “ (i. e. on' oath,) and filed before the cause is called upon the ap- “ pearance docket.”
Section 34th declares,: “ That.the assignée or endorsee may bring “ suit in his own name; nor shall ""it be necessary fdr the assigned or “ endorsee of any instrument, assignable by law, to set-forth in the “ declaration the consideration upon which such assignment or en- “ dorsement was made; nor to prove such consideration, unless the “ same shall be impeached, by the defendant, under oath.”
The instruments “ assignable by law,” referred to in this, and the thirty-third section of the same act, are bonds, notes, covenants, deeds, bills of exchange, or other writings, whereby money is promised or secured to be paid; and the assignment of these instruments vests in the assignee or endorsee, the same rights, powers and capacities, as are possessed by the assignor or endorser. >
The subjects arising for the consideration of the Court in the cause before us, involve the discussion of the inquiry, whether the statutes cited can be legally applied to the present case ; and between what parties to suits in promissory notes, their aid is to be invoked in the defence of those actions. •
Statutes of the character of those under review, while in some degree they bear the impress of a remedial character, are entitled to a fair construction as to those in whose favor they are enacted, so far as is requisite to carry out the intention of the Legislature, when that intention, by legal rules of construction, can be ascertained.
Ordinarily, remedial statutes seem intended to supply any defects or imperfections in common law, where the remedy is deemed imperfect, or too narrow, to subserve the ends of justice, when they become what are termed enlarging statutes; but those under consideration cannot be embraced in that class, as they do not amplify or add to the remedy, as known at the common law; but being in derogation of it, should be construed strictly, for it is laid down that a statute, which takes away a common law remedy, ought never to have an equitable construction.
The statutes before us certainly affect the remedy hitherto possessed by the plaintiff, in suits on promissory notes, by throwing the onusprobandi upon him, by the defendant’s taking the oath, as prescribed by the statutes. They are in direct derogation of the old rules of the common law, as to the defence of actions, and the principles oí evidence, as to suits brought upon the above instruments.
Chancellor Kent says, that statutes are to be construed “ in refe- “ rencé to the principles of the common law, for it is not to be sup- “ posed, that the Legislature intended any innovation of the common “ law, further than the case absolutely required.” 1 Kent Com. 464. And Lord Tenderden remarks that, “ there is always danger “in giving effect to what is called the equity of a statute ; it is much “better and safer to rely on, and abide by the plain words, although the Legislature might'.have provided for other cases, had “their attention been' directed towards them.” 6 B. & C. 475.
From a review of the. statutes cited, and being in pari materia, they should be construed together: the effect is clearly this — that upon the oath being taken, in compliance with the requisitions of. the statute* and by proper parties, the onus of proof is thrown upon the plaintiff, and he is bound to prove the consideration of the'instrument:, upon which suit is1 brought. The 24th. section of the act cited is silent, as to the partiesibetween whom the consideration can be gone into; and in accordance with the views herein before expressed,» we are of' opinion that it can only be applied between such parties as- the 'consideration could have been entered into at common law. . It .is possible that this section may have been intended to have had a more extended operation — if so, there is. a casus omissus, and' this cannot be supplied ,by a Court of law, for that would'be the assumption of legislative powers by the Judiciary, and we are bound to take the laws, as the-.Legislature haye enacted them.
The 34th section of the act is sufficiently explicit,' and clearly relates to suit brought by the assignee or endorsee.of the instruments therein set forth, against the assignor or endorser, .and-seems to have an eye to the-privity existing between parties; at least, to notes and bills of exchange. • , ■ .
' Tó give any other construction to these statutes', would produce-results, which the Legislature could never have intended or anticipated — if otherwise, there would be no safety in thé receiving or- purchasing any of the instruments set out in the statute, particularly bills of exchange and promissory notes; These being assignable by endorsement or delivery, circulating from hand to'hand, in accordance with the liberal and comprehensive notions of commercial policy, and entering into every day transactions of life, every consideration* demands, that.no restraint should be placed upon their free circulation, by the enforcement of a principle of defence, not set forth in the plain words of .the act, and- in restraint, of the remedy at common law.
The question-now arises, can the consideration of the note in suit be gone into between White, the endorsee, and Camp, the itíaker of the note, by the common law. t ■ ■ '
The total, or partial want, or failure of consideration, or the illegality. of consideration, may be insisted upon ás a defence or a bar between any of the intermediate or original parties to the contract. It may be insisted upon by the maker against'the payee, and by the payee and his endorser, and cannot be inquired into between the endorsee and the maker. 208 Story on Prom. Notes. Braman vs. Hess, 13 John. R. 52.
The holder of a negotiable instrument, taken before due, is prima facia rightful owner of it, and he need not prove consideration, except circumstances of suspicion appear; arid to render it void in the hands of an innocent endorsee, there must be a knowledge of the want, failure, or illegality of consideration. 4 Hill, 442. 6 Wendell, 615.
The defendant in the Court below, though he pleaded illegality, want and failure of consideration, et cetera, adduced no proof that the plaintiff took the instrument sued upon, under suspicious circumstances, or with knowledge of the defects alledged ; and the rule now is, that the endorsee, when plaintiff; need not prove a tona fide consideration paid by himself, until some suspicion is cast upon his title. 1 Moody & Robinson, 366.
So far as the evidence in the Court below is concerned, White is clearly a bonafi.de holder, for a valuable consideration, without notice — and in accordance with the law, as to notes payable on demand, a holder before the note was due.
The presumption of law is, that when a bill or note is endorsed in blank, that it was endorsed on the day of its date, or at least before it was due. If the defendant alledges, that it was endorsed after it was due, the burthen of proof is on him to shew it. 137 Bailey on Bills. Pinkerton vs. Bailey, 8 Wendell R. 600. When a promissory note, payable on demand, is endorsed within a reasonable, time after its date, the endorsee has all the rights of an endorsee receiving á negotiable instrument before it comes due. If not endorsed in a reasonable time, it is considered as overdue, and dishonored, and the endorsee will be subject to any defence, which would have been available against his endorser. 135 Bailey on Bills. 4 Mass. 370. What is considered reasonable time, is not precisely settled, but depends upon the circumstances of each particular case ; but the presumption -is, that it was transferred within a reasonable time, unless the contrary is proved. 137 Bailey on Bills..
The Court, upon a view of the case, is of opinion, that the affidavit of Camp should have been treated as a nullity ,• that the Court erred in receiving it; and that the cause should have been tried solely upon common law principles. But even if the affidavit should have been received, it is not such a one as the statute required. It should have been drawn in issuable terms, and confined to a single allegation — not in the alternative or double — but should have been so constructed, rendering it analagous to the old English rule of notice, as to have apprized the party plaintiff, what facts he would be required to prove upon the trial. It first denies the consideration of the note ; and if it was valid and legal, it has totally failed, while the facts as set forth in the notice, would seem to make out a case of original consideration of the note.
In conclusion, we think the errors well taken. The judgment in the Court below must be reversed — the cause remanded to the Court below — and venire de novo awarded.
Douglas, Chief Justice:
At common law, promissory notes and bills of exchange were negotiable; they imported a consideration ; if endorsed before they fell due, the consideration could not be gone into, except between the original parties, unless there were some suspicious circumstances attending the transaction; and if there was nothing to shew the time when the endorsement was made, it was presumed to have been made before they fell due. If endorsed after they become due, the endorsee took th,em, subject to all the equities that existed between the original parties thereto.
The first clause of the 34th sec. of our judicial act, Duval’s Comp. 96, makes, any bond, note, covenant, deed, bill of exchange, or other writing, whereby money is promised, or secured to be paid, transferable by assignment or endorsement.
It is proper to remark here, that this act was passed in the year 1828, and that the Legislature, at the same session, repealed the act which had before introduced into the Territory of Florida the common law of England. This judicial act, therefore, was the only law in force in Florida, touching these several classes of instruments, until the common law was again introduced in the year 1829. Hence, the reason why notes and bills of exchange are found in this category.
Many of these instruments, although made negotiable by assignment or endorsement, did not, at common law, import a consideration ; and without that law,, a doubt might well have been entertained, even in regard to those which did. To remedy this inconvenience, and carry out the views of the Legislature as to all, which it is presumed, was to increase the quantity of negotiable paper, in a new country, where there were few mercantile transactions, and the circulating medium was scarce, the 24th sec. of the same act declared, that all promissory notes, and other instruments of writing, not under seal, should have the same force and effect, as bonds and instruments under seal.
The full effect of this provision upon these instruments, has never., (so far as I am aware,) been judicially determined. It certainly has not been supposed, by the legal profession, to give them such an effect, that an action of covenant could be maintained upon any one of them.
But they import a' consideration,, and without some further provision, the plaintiff could not, in any case, have been required to prove such .consideration, unless it had been impeached by jproof on the part of the defendant.
The last clause of the 34th sec. above cited, therefore declared, that the assignee or endorsee of any such instrument, might bring suit in his own name; and that it should not be necessary for the as-signee or endorsee of any instrument, assignable by law, to set forth in the declaration, the consideration upon which such assignment or endorsement was made; nor to prove such consideration, unless the same should be impeached by the defendant under oath. And the 2d clause of the 24th section also declared, that it should not be necessary for the plaintiff to prove the execution of any bond, note, or other instrument of writing, purporting to have been signed by the defendant, or the consideration for which the same was given, unless the same shall be denied by plea, put in on oath.
What is the converse of these propositions ? Why, that ii such plea is put in on oath, in the one case, or the consideration in the other is impeached under oath, the plaintiff must prove the. execution and consideration in the one case, and the assignment, or endorsement, and consideration thereof in the other — in all cases where the rule would apply to such instruments, so endorsed, at common law— for notwithstanding the Legislature had repealed that law, it cannot be supposed that they legislated, without any regard to its wise and equitable provisions.
The object of the Legislature was, as before remarked, to increase the quantity oí negotiable paper; but tbgse provisions of the statute would, in a, great measure, have defeated their own object, if such plea or impeachment required this proof from the plaintiff in any case, except between the immediate parties to the instrument, or where the plaintiff had taken it after it had become due, or under such other suspicious circumstances, as should have put him on inquiry.
We are warranted, therefore, I think, in the conclusion, that these provisions of this statute only apply, as between the immediate parties to the'transaction, or such others as have taken these instruments after due, or have not acted in good faith, or with due circumspection in cases attended with suspicion; and this, as I understand it, is all that the opinion, délivered yesterday by Judge Hawkins, in this case intended to assert on the subject. Baltzell, Justice,
dissenting:
In the decision made in this case I fully concur, but do not agree to those parts of the opinions delivered which declare, “ from a re- “ view of the statutes cited and being in pari materia, they should be “ construed together: the effect is clearly this — that upon the oath be- “ ing taken in compliance with the requisites of the statute and by il proper parties, the onus of proof is thrown upon plaintiff, and he “ is bound to prove the consideration of the instrument upon which “ suit is brought.” And in the opinion of the Chief Justice, “ We “ are warranted therefore I think in the conclusion, that these provi- “ sions of this statute only apply as between the immediate parties “ to the transaotjpn, or such others as have taken these instruments “ alter due, or have not acted in good faith or with due circumspection “ in cases attended with suspicion.” Whilst the decision of the Court exempts.bills of exchange and promissory notes in the hands of an innocent holder from the effect of the provision of the statute cited, this clause declares that all other instruments are subject to it, and that in cáse of suits brought upon them where an affidavit denying the consideration is filed, the burthen of proof is thrown upon plaintiff to establish it. I greatly regret that an expression of opinion upon this point was deemed necessary, as it did not occur in the case, had not been argued and was not presented by the record. It has been made however, and imposes upon me the duty of expressing my own views upon the subject, though reluctant to declare a dissent from the opinion of a majority of the Court. This is rendered the more necessary from the fact that the construction given, if persevered in, will lead in my opinion to very great embarrassment in practice, if not to serious injury and injustice to parties.
The position is that the plea of no consideration, verified by affidavit, throws the burthen of proof on plaintiff. That the plea of itself has not this effect is evident, being “ a mere statement of de. fendant’s ground of defence.” 8 Blacks. Com. 225.
Has the plea with the affidavit this effect? The question may in some degree be answered by inquiring into the purposes and objects for which affidavits are used when attached to pleas and other proceedings.
“ Affidavits are usually for certifying the service of process or other matter touching the proceedings in a cause.” 1 Jacob’s Law Diet. 64.
Also, by adverting to cases of pleas, to which affidavits are required by law.
Dilatory pleas are required to be under oath by statute, so also, pleas, puis darrien continuance. 1 Chitty, 452-8 — 638.
An oath is required “ to prove the truth thereof, or show some probable matter to the Court, to induce them to believe that the fact of such dilatory plea is true.” Ibid, 452. _ ,
It is no where held or even intimated, that in any of these pleas so supported by affidavit, the burthen of proof of the matter pleaded* is thrown on the plaintiff.
To give the plea and affidavit the effect asserted would be to make them more than proof; by throwing the proof on the other side they are in this respect conclusive until rebutted by stronger testimony. Now I cannot find that the voluntary affidavit of a defendant is any where, in any 'of the books regarded as evidence, mijch less as conclusive.
“ The plaintiff or defendant may take affidavit, yet it will not be “ admitted in evidence at the trial, but only on motion.” 1 Lilly, 44. 1 Jacob’s Law Diet. 64.
“ It is undoubtedly a sound rule, which ought never to he violated, “ that no man can be a witness in his oum cause. The affidavit of a K party is received on many incidental questions addressed to the Court, “ and do not effect the issue to he tried hy the jury. The testimony “ which establishes the loss of a paper is addressed to the Court, and “ does'not relate to the contents of the paper. It.is a fact which may “ be important, as letting in the party to prove the justice oí the “ cause, but does not itself prove any thing in the cause,” Ch. Just. Marshal, in Taylor vs. Riggs, 1 Peters, 597.
“ The general rule is that a party to the record in a civil suit can- “ not be a witness either for himself or for a co-suitor in the cause.” Greenleaf, 378.
“ But though in criminal cases the exceptions are few indeed, in “ which a party'interested may not be a witness, in' civil, cases there “ is harály at common law an instance where the case is so circum- “ stanced that he may, and this upon clear reasons operating such ex* “ elusion. Ah universal 'exclusion, where no line short of this could “ have been drawn, preserves infirmity from . a snare, and integrity “ from suspicion and keeps the current of evidence thus far at least, “clear and uninfected.” 1 Gilb. Ev. by Loft. 223 — 224.
If the defendant is permitted to make evidence in his own cause, let, the privilege be mutual, and extended to .plaintiff, and let both be examined as witnesses. , ' ■ ‘
Whilst no authority can be found for making the affidavit of the party, evidence* for him on a, trial before a jury, the 3aw.is'well settled, that the. affidavit of defendant is evidence against' him. 2 Starkie’s Ev. 21. ’ ' /
•It may be regarded as, established, ! think, that an affidavit'attached ^to a pleads not evidence, and cannot be read to the jury. Its only effect then, according to the authorities, would seem to be that “ of certifying or proving the truth thereof to the Court, ’to induce tíiem to believe the fact of the plea to be true.” - , •
I have thus far consideréd the question on general principles and the authorities bearing upon the point. It is now proper to advert to the statute itself, to ascertain the design of the Legislature in passing the law which is the subject of consideration. ^
“ Three points are tó be considered in the construction of all reme - “dial statutes, tKe old law, the mischiéf and the remedy; that'is how “ the common law stood at the making of the act, what the mischief “ was for which the Common Law did not provide, and what remedy “ the Legislature provided tó cure the mischief; and it is the b'usi- “ ness of the judges so to construe the act as to suppress the mischief “ and advance the remedy.” 1 Blacks. . Com.- 87. 1 Rent, 464.
First let us4e'e what the common law. was previous to the passage of this statute. “ Inadequacy of consideration in sealed instruments “ could not be impeached or inquired into at Law, for every bond “ from the solemnity of the instrument carries internal evidence of a “ good consideration.” 2 Blacks. 445 and notes. • ,
“Bills of exchange and promissory notes, partake also, of\ this pri- “ ilege ; hence it was unnecessary to establish that a promissory nóte “ was given for a consideration, and the burthen of proof rested on “ the other party to establish the contrary, and to rebut the presump. “•tion of validity and value raised by the law for the protection and “ support of negotiable- paper,” 2 Blacks. 446. Story on prom, notes, 197, 2Q7-8, Sec. 181. '
Contracts in writing not under seal had not this‘privilege, and in reference to them, consideration was required to be proved by plaintiff. 2 Black,'446, n. 7 T. R. 360.
The mischief then was, first,the difierence prevailing between writings with and without seals, which by the advance of civilization had become more in name than, reality. , Secondly, the frequent contesting of the consideration of written instruments on insufficient grounds. Thirdly, that the consideration of sealed writings could not be inquired into. .
The remedy was 1st, to put all written instruments on the same footing, by giving to all the force and effect of bonds and instruments under seal; and secondly, to allow them to be contested, only 'by affidavit; hence it was declared not necessary for the plaintiff to prove “ the consideration for which any bond, note or .other instrument of writing was given, unless the same shall be denied by plea put in and filed under oath.” Now of this it may be premised that the statute does not, say that plaintiff shall prove the consideration, if it is1 denied by defendant; which would have left no room for construction, being a clear and decided expression of the legislative will; but the expression is “it shall not be'necesary unless denied,” which is tantamount to an expression merely, that if the defendant do not deny the consideration on oath, it shall riot be. necessary for plaintiff to prove it, but shall, be taken as proved; and if denied by affidavit, it shall be considered as put in issue, to be tried according to the rules pf law governing in such cases. ,
The issue-is to be proved by the party raising it; nor; is it an answer to say that defendant is not required to prove a nagative, and that this plea is of this character. It is not every negative a party is relieved from proving, and I apprehend this issue’ is of that character. 4 Mass. 349. 4 Pick. 174. , ""
By this construction according to my view, the mischief, in the mind of the Legislature,.is fully avoided and the remedy advanced.By it uniformity in these instrUriients is effected, the verity -attached from time immemorial to sealed instruments as the deliberate and solemn act of the parties is preserved, and they at the same time are. not relieved from a wholesome, and proper enquiry on a proper show-ingby defendant of the want of consideration. By it a wise and beneficial operation is given to the Statute, and every reasonable design of the Legislature is accomplished. But' suppose the other construction tq prevail, and the consideration is taken as disproved, so as to throw the burthen upon plaintiff; is it not perceived that the whole force and character of'the instrument is at the mercy of one of the parties, and that party by his own solemn act, and every rule of right and propriety, estopped from making such a defence. ;If this rule is to prevail, there can be no farther use fon a bond, note or other obligation, hitherto adopted'as the means of terminating a difficulty or dispute by some solepin act, having an admitted legal sanction. Is it not seen too that this rule will be highly injurious in case of notes, bills of exchange, bonds and other sealed instruments, which by the consent of almost jhe whole civilized world, from their very structure import a verity, and are regarded as made on consideration ; and with what, propriety can it be supposed that the Legislature,in an act affirming the force an'd effect of these instruments, could have designed a provision by implication aimed at their vitality, and calculated inore than all others to destroy, their efficacy; ■ -
If it be true, as asserted by the Court in a rule of construction appealed to by them, “ that it is not to be. supposed that the Legislature “ intended any innovation of -the common law, further than the case absolutely requiredthen I think we may safely conclude, that the construction asserted is not the correct one. *•
There would be “ an innovation not absolutely required,” in my opinion, by allowing the defendant to make evidence for himself, though an exparte affidavit, in violation of all principle, by throwing the proof from the shoulders of defendant on those of plaintiff, of an issue raised and presented by himself, and a further most injurious innovation by destroying the verity -of sealed instruments and other writings. Such a rule, in my opinion, would create a greater mischief than that which the statute was designed to 'remedy. And its consequences are not tq be confined to this Statute. Complainants file an affidavit to their bills in chancery, defendants- to their plea to an application, to foreclose mortgages at law; under the law for the trial of the right of property, plaintiff files his affidavit, and other instances not on our statute book. Are these also, to be embraced by the same construction ? - . ,
It will not do to say that an answer in' Chancery bears • an analogy to the present case, since defendant is called- on by plaintiff to give his testimony, and thus njakes the answer evidence against him. Greenleaf’s Ev. 897.
I shall conclude my views of this subject by referring to other rules of construction pertinent to it, and which ought to have their bearing in its consideration.
“ Thus the real intention when accurately ascertained, will al- “ ways prevail over the literal sense of terms, and the reason and in- “ tention of the law giver will control the strict letter of the law, “ when the latter would lead to palpable injustice, contradiction and absurdity.” “ When the words are not explicit, the intention is to “ be collected from the context, from the occasion and"" necessity of the law, from the mischief félt and the remedy in view; and the in- “ tention is to be taken according to what is consonant to reason and “ good discretion.” Plowden, 205. 1 Kent’s Com. 462.
“ Where fundamental principles are overthrown, when the gener- “ al system of the laws is departed from, the legislative intention must .“be expressed with irresistible clearness, to induce a Court of Justice to suppose a design to effect.such objects.” 2 Cranch, ,358. 1 Cond. R. 421.
It will be no answer to say that a similar provision, and the same words are used as to the denial of the execution of a bond. To this it may be replied that a' different rule prevailing as to it, á different construction of the statute is necessary. A plea of non est fclctum at common law, always put the proof of the signature on plaintiff, whereas the consideration of bonds and .notes was never required to be proved by plaintiff nor allowed to be.questioned from the fact, that the party having made a solemn act of such character, was estopped to deny its validity. ,
. “ It is by no means a correct rule of interpretation, to construe the “ same word in the same sense, wherever it occurs in the same in- “ strument. It was very justly observed by Ch. Jus. Marshall in “ the Cherokee Nation vs. State of Georgia, that it has been said, “ that the same words have not necessarily the same meaning attach- “ ed to them, when found in different parts .of the same instrument. “ Their meaning is controlled by the contract.” 1 Story’s Com. Const. 440. 5 Peters, 119."
"Martha Ann Manly, Administratrix, and Hiram Manly, Administor in right of his Wife, of Samuel Parkhill Deceased, vs. The Union Bank of Florida",1 Fla. 110,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Hawkusts, Justice:
The Court, in the case before it, have examined the record with care, and. will endeavor so to adjudicate upon it, as that the legal rights of parties, as they appear, may be adjusted in accordance with the rules of law, -pointing out those errors which may. appear, aVid sustaining the legal rights of the respective’ parties, when they are correctly and substantially' set out' and embodied in the pleadings. The case has been so ably and elaborately argued; — the arguments of counsel so elucidated by-authorities — that the Court feels itself much relieved from the embarrassments .which might otherwise exist, as to the arrival at proper conclusions, and a correct decision of the cause. . -.
To rebut, the first error, it is contended by the .appellee, that the defendant in the Court below, by putting in a plea of puis darrein continuance, waived and abandoned all former pleas.
There can be no doubt that, by the common law of England, and adhered to' in this country, a plea of puis darrein continuance, is always pleaded by way of substitution for the forpaerplea ;.and though not a departure from, is a waiver of it; and when it is pleaded, the case stands in the same state, as if the plea had been one originally put in. Stephen on PI. 66. Chitty on PL 697. 1¡ Archbold’s Practice, 20(0. '
The only cases cited by the, counsel for the appellant; which seem to have at all a conflicting bearing, are Rayner & Hope vs. Dyett, 2 Wendell R. 301; and Calver vs. Burney, 14 Wendell R. 162. Nor have the Court, in its researches been able to find authorities at variance with the doctrines just laid down.
The first case was, where the defendant obtained a discharge, of his person from imprisonfnent, under the act to abolish 'imprisonment for debt in certain cases — and this discharge he pleaded puis darrein continuance, after having pleaded in bar to the action. The plaintiff confessed the plea puis darrein continuance, proceeded and entered a rule for interlocutory judgment. On motion to set aside the rule, Judge Sutherland, while admitting the general rule of waiver, said: “ This was not an admission of the plaintiff’s right of action, nor did it set up any new matter of defence to the action it only affected the remedy, not the rights of the plaintiffand that the pleas were not waived. In Calver vs. Burney, 14 Wendell, 162, the same Judge sustains the general doctrine, and while affirming the decision of Rayner & Hope vs. Dyett, remarks: “ That the rule does not apply, where the matter of the plea affects the plaintiff’s remedy only, and not his right of action;” that the above case “ sought to modify the remedy, and not to defeat the action.”
In the case before us, the plea is intended to go directly to the action itself; it is pleaded in bar, and partakes of a peremptory, and not a dilatory character; and the Court cannot view these two cases in the light of authorities, having a direct bearing upon, and application to the cause at bar. -
The appellant’s counsel contend, that the statute of Florida destroys the old common law rule, as to the doctrine of waiver of the pleas originally pleaded, by the plea, puis darrein continuance, and cites the 26th section of “An act to amend an act regulating judicial proceed, ings,” approved Nov. 23, 1828, which is in these words : “ Sec. 26. Be it further enacted, That in all cases the defendant or defendants may plead as many matters of law or fact as he, she or they, may deem necessary to his, her or their defence; and it shall be no objection to any plea, that it.is contradictory to any other plea filed by the same party in the same cause.” Duval’s Com. 95.
If this question rested solely upon the common law doctrine, the Court would have no difficulty in deciding that the first error was not well assigned; but the statute above cited interposes, and overturns, as we think, the entire structure of the common law doctrine, as to the waiver of former pleas, by a plea puis darrein continuance. The statute in its face, by its purview and spirit, seems evidently intended to abolish, to a certain extent, some of the rigid rules and technicalities incident to pleading at common law, to enable the defendant to avail himself of all and every possible defence, however contradictorily pleaded, which, by the old rules of , pleading, he was unable to do; and in fine, by the liberality and comprehensiveness of its terms, to effect the furtherance of justice.
A statute of this nature, however much in some instances we may deplore an innovation upon the common law, commends itself to the liberal construction of a Court, whose aim should be, at all times, the substantial justice of the case.
We look around us, and see the attempts of different States of the Union to simplify the science of pleading, so as to enable the parties litigant to set forth their respective claims and defences, irrespective of the rigid rules Of that science, and to infuse info it a spirit of liberality ; and while unquestionably they"" admire the beauty and force of the fundamental reasons on which the science of pleading is founded, and the ingenuity with which its rules are carried o'ut, yet possibly, they may conceive, that,greater simplicity, may not be incompatible with the grave deductions of logic. . • -
- The doctrine, as contended for byth,a appellee, took its-rise'ih the early stages of the law, and. we find( it,in the. oldest books. ' It has stood the-test of time, in all its.vigor, and has been carried out in. the Courts of England and this country-; and but. that we think it contravenes the true intent and spirit-qf our statute, we would feel loth to impugn its authority, or deny its. application.’
Originally, at-common law, there could regularly,be only ope' plea, on' which, if. there were issue or demurrer, the cause was to be determined, because there could be only one'verdict in a cause'; and though.th’e statute of Anne permitted several pleas, still they, were’to be in unison, sustaining and nof contradictory to eaóh othér,. Multiplicity of pleading, was to be avoided, and the use of pleading was, to reduce the matters in pleading to a single point.
In framing-them, there is.required-great care and nicety,; and it is said: “It seems dangerous to plead any matter puis darrein continu“ance, unless'you be well advised; because, if that matter be< deter- “ mined against you, it is a confession of the matter in issue, and no “nisi.prius shall be awarded.” -6 Bacon Ab. 479. And should the plea puis be defective, and-.be-quashed, the judgment is at-once quod recuperet, and not respondeos ouster.- ■ ■ •
If the object of the statute was 'to -simplify the rules of pleading and soften down the rigid; (and in this instance) the arbitrary dicta of the common law, where So proper an occasion for the attainment 'of the object, or the fulfilment of its'intentions,” as in a case where even at common law, more than usual severity is to. be observed. ?
Why should the statute operate unequally by the extension of its liberalizing policy to other cases, and this, in which most required, be exempt from its genial influence, .because not described in totidem verbis? Although a doctrine relying for its support upon the hardships, which might arise under it, is at all times dangerous as tending to .destroy established precedents, yet construing the statute before us by an appropriate rule-of construction, a desire to suppress the mischief and advance the-remedy,-we can perceive many cases, where great hardships would inevitably arise, Persons at all times "" may not be “ well advised” as to the pleading, and great injustice might be done by depriving a party of his legal defence pleaded in the first instance, because his plea of puis darrein continuance happened to be defective ; and why, if that plea is annulled, should not the party be remitted to his original defence ? To all this it may be answered, that the law is different, and the maximfiat justicia should be followed, and that arguments ab inconvenienti should be avoided. We contend that the statute has altered the law ; we point to its spirit, its context, and we must look at the true, meaning of words.
The statute says, that “ in dll cases,” the defendants may plead, &c. Is this phrase to be circumscribed by the meaning attached to it, by strict legal parlance, or is its true import to be gathered from the purview of the statute, and the true definition of its terms ? The dictionaries tell us, that “ case” means or signifies, a contingence, a state of things, and if either of these synonyma was used in the statute, any and all doubt, would be dissipated.
The ample scope and free license to plead any number and contrariety of pleas granted by the Statute, have destroyed the reasons upon which the common law rule rests; and we can perceive no good cause when the reason of a law has ceased to exist, why the law itself should have a being, in direct conflict, as we think, with our statute, against the policy of our laws, and if persisted in, calculated to produce no good results, but rather consequences replete with hardship and extreme injustice ; and with the views expressed, we clearly are of opinion, that this rule of the common law, as to pleas puis dar-rein continuance, should cease to be regarded by the juridical tribunals of the State.
The first error is therefore well assigned.
As to the plea pais darrein continuance, we think it well pleaded. It is contended that this plea should have been in abatement and not' in bar. We think that the defendant could have pleaded in either ; she could have pleaded in abatement, that she was not administra-trix of Samuel Parkhill deceased, but was administratrix de bonis non of said Parkhill, and there can be no doubt, but that she could plead ne ungues administratrix. The authorities are full upon -this subject.
To an’ action against an executor, he may plead in bar ne ungues executor, That be renounced, and nulla bona devenerunt ad manas; so he may plead in bar, the same bar as his testator could have done, as non assumpsit, or non est factum. 6 Comyn’s Digest, 2, D. 7, 8.
So an administrator may plead in bar ne unques administrator. 6 Comyn’s dig. 2, D. 12. 1 Tidd, p. 644.
To an action against an administrator he may plead in abatement that he is not administrator, but executor, ib, 2, D. 12, page, 315 ; thus by analogy establishing the principle before asserted, that Martha Ann Manley might have pleaded jn abatement if she thought proper, that she was not administratrix, but administratrix de bonis non, and it is equally clear, that she could plead in bar ne tinques adminis-tratrix. Pleas in bar are calculated to show either that the plaintiff never had any cause of action, or if he had, that it is discharged by subsequent matter. 1 Tidd, p. 643.
“ Whenever the subject matter of the plea or defence is, that the plaintiff cannot maintain any action at any time, whether present or future, in respect of the supposed .cause of action, it may and usually must be pleaded in bar.” 1 Chitty on pleading, 481. A plea in abatement must not only show the error to the plaintiff, but enable him to correct it by giving him materials for avoiding the same mistake in another-, suit in regard to the same cause of action, and give the plaintiff a better writ: ib.
The plea in bar in this case we think good, because the Union Bank could not at any time after the defendant’s dismissal from the first administratorship, have brought suit against her in the capacity of administratrix simply; that e. 6. instanti, the letters of administration were taken from her and annulled, she became as to the suit cemliter mortuus; and all the rights, powers, duties and liabilities, which had previously attached to her in the character of administra-trix ceased and no longer existed. In Toler on Executors, 131, it is laid down where letters of administration are revoked, if an action be brought by an administrator, and while it is pending, administration is committed to another, the suit is abated.
In the case of Taylor vs. Savage, 1 Howard U. S. R. 286, there was a decree in favor of Taylor against George M. Savage, the executor of Samuel Savage deceased: On the very day of the decree, George M. Savage was removed,from-his executorship, and one Benham appointed administrator de bonis non — the Court in that case said : “ By his.(George W. Savage,) removal from the office of executor, he was as completely separated from the business of the executor, as if he had been dead, and had no right to appear in or be a party in this or any other Court, to a suit, which the law confided to the representative of the deceased.” No further proceedings could be therefore had in the decree of the District Court, until Ben-ham the administrator'tie bonis non was made a party.
The defendant in this cause could no doubt have come in voluntarily and made herself a party as administratrix de bonis non to the suit, by due and proper application to the Court, bút this she did not do. The case of Hunt vs. Wilkinson, 2 Call. 41, is cited by the appellant. It seems that a Mrs. Hunt had been appointed a general administratrix of Charles Hunt deceased; that an office judgment was obtained.against her in that capacity; upon its being set aside, she was permitted to plead, that since the last continuance, the will of the said Charles Hunt had been committed to record, and that administration with the will annexed was committed to her, whereby she became bound to surrender her letters of administration granted to her before the appearance of the Will'; that she ought to bé sued as administratrix with the will annexed of Charles Hunt deceased, and not as administratrix ; Judge Carrington remarked: “ In this case, at the time of their office judgment, Mrs. Hunt was defendant in her character of general administratrix ; but before the end of that term, that character had ceased, all her powers in that capacity were done away and destroyed by the production and proof of. the will; so that she was no longer general administratrix, but was then acting in a character correspondent to that of executrix, charged with the execu - tion of the will, instead of the statutory administration.
The plea was sustained as a good plea, and it was after two arguments, decided that an administratrix with the will annexed, must be sued in that character, and if sued as administratrix only, without the .addition of the words “ with the will annexed,” she may plead in abatement.
This case so clearly in point, where the facts bear so close an affinity to those in the present- cause, its decision emanating front so high a source, and supported too by other authorities, entitles it to the most respectful consideration of this Court. In this case a plea in abatement was pleaded and sustained, and the question as to plea in bar did not arise. That question arose for direct adjudication in the case of James Jewett vs. Betsey Jewett, administratrix of Caleb Jewett, 5 Mass. 276. This was an action against Betsey Jewett as administratrix; she pleaded in bar, with a protestando, (as in this case) that she had no effects, &c., of the intestate in-her hands to be administered ; that since the commencement of the action, she had been removed from the administration by the Judge of Probate, on the petition of James Jewett, the‘plaintiff.
It was contended on demurrer to this plea, that the plea should have been in abatement, being in the nature of a plea to the person. C. J. Parsons, said, “in the case at bar, if the matter of the plea be good, it shows that the plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendant, either in this or any other suit; it is therefore properly pleaded in bar.”
It is contended by the appellee that the defendant should have pleaded plene administravit, or that she handed over the assets to the new administrator, and should have retained sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s demand. , ■
The first objection as to the plea plene administravit cannot now receive consideration, as by the decision of the Court in the former part of this opinion, the plea not being waived, is still in full force and being, and undisposed of.
The law as laid down in 11 Yiner t Ab. 119, is in these words : “ the defendant being sued as administrator, pleaded, that before the day of the writ, his administration was removed and granted to another ; per Wild, he ought to have set forth that he had fully administered the goods in his hands, or else that he had delivered them over to the new administrator, for otherwise the debtor might be at a loss, for those goods shall not be assets in the hands of the new administrator till they come into his possession.”
It is true, that the defendant did not plead plene administravit, in the plea jaws darrein continuance, or in a different plea, but she pleaded, that she was removed from the administration ; that by the order of the Court she was divested and put out of possession of all the estate, rights, credits and effects of Sam’l Parkhill, deceased, in her hands to be administered; that she was not allowed to retain, and did not retain in her hands sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff’s action, or any part thereof, but that the whole of them were placed by the order of the Court in the hands of its Marshal.
A plea plene administravit even if not in before, would perhaps have been considered superfluous, inasmuch as all the assets being taken out of her hands, there was nothing left to administer, and the replication admits, that all effects et cetera which were of Samuel Parkhill, deceased, at the time of his death, and which came to the hands of Martha Ann Parkhill to be administered, and which remained in her hands unadministered, when the same were by order of the said Superior Court, taken away from said Martha Anne as in the plea alledged.
It was impossible for the defendant to have retained assets as at common law, for the order of the Court was imperative, and an attempt to retain would have been idle and futile. This argument, coming from a party upon whose petition the order was made, does not appear with a very good grace. Nor could she have pleaded, that she handed over the assets to the new administrator, for the plea would have been false; nor can we discern any impropriety in the plea pleaded, drawn as we think with sufficient legal correctness and nicety, setting forth a good and substantial defence by way of bar to the action, based upon facts which are admitted by the party plaintiff,'
Could an execution have correctly issued on the judgment obtained against the defendant ? It could not have been issued against the estate in the hands of Martha Ann Parkhill, the general admin-istratrix, because there was no such character in existence; nor against Martha Ann Parkhill, as administratrix de bonis.non, because the execution should have pursued the judgment stricily, otherwise it would be void; and the judgment here is against the said Martha, as the general administratrix.
It is urged that a privity existed between Martha Manley as general administratrix, and Martha Manley, administratrix de bonis non. That a certain privity at common law exists, it must be admitted— as between administrator and administrator de bonis non, or executor and administrator de bonis non, with the will annexed. There seems to bo a distinction as to this privity, in suits by or against administrators — in the former none existed, which probably gave rise to the statute of 17 Charles 2, C. 8, which enabled an administrator de bonis non to take out execution on a judgment of an executor or administrator. 8 Cowen 340. It was laid down by C. J. Parsons, “ that an administrator de bonis non with the will annexed, could not sustain a writ of error to reverse a judgment recovered by the original executor, because there is in law no privity between an executor and administrator de bonis non, with the will annexedand a judgment recovered by the executor, cannot be executed by the succeeding administrator. Grant vs. Chamberlain, 4 Mass. 612. This was cited by the appellant.
But the same Judge remarks, that the statute of Charles 2d is not in force in his State, and indicates that his decision would have been the reverse, if it had.
If judgment had been obtained against the defendant, and she had died, no doubt but that scire facias would 'lie against the administrator de bonis non. 8 Cowen 339, citing Norgate vs. Snap, (W. Jon. 214.)
Admitting the doctrine of privity to the fullest extent, how does it avail in the present case ? The suit against Martha Manleys ‘ad-ministratrix, abated as completely by her removal, as if she had died ; and the suit should have been brought de novo, against her; in her new capacity of administratrix de bonis non. The two characters were incompatible, and could not exist together. If the defendant had wasted the goods, she would have been .liable in an action of debt, in case the administration had been granted to another. 472 Wentworth on Exrs. — and besides, would be responsible to the new administrator.
The fact that the property and assets again came to her hands at the time of the plea pleaded, does not vary the result; for though identically the same person, yet legally viewed, Martha Manley, ad-ministratrix, and Martha Manley, administratrix de bonis non, are separate and distinct characters — appointed by different grants of administration, giving different securities, and not similar in any respect, save the duties and powers incident to the administration. The sureties of the first administration were certainly discharged, after the dismissal of the defendant, as to all her acts posterior to that event; and the second sureties were not responsible for any of her acts previous to her second appointment. Another consideration is, that in case this suit should be sustained, the securities of the first administration would continue liable for the result of this suit, although the functions of the general administratrix had ceased, and who yet might be involved, if creditors were allowed to proceed upon the first administration. The blending of the two characters would be attended with many perplexities and embarrassments, and in all probability, with great injustice.
We will now confine our attention to the pleadings of the cause.
“It is a rule in pleading, that oh demurrer, the Court will consider the whole record, and give judgment for the party who, on the whole, appears entitled to it.” . Stephens on Pleading, 144. And if the pleading be bad, judgment shall be had against him, who made the first default. 6 Comyn’s Digest, 183. And it matters not, whether the issue be of law or fact, and whether the cause has proceeded to issue or not, the Court is always bound to examine the whole record, and adjudge for the plaintiff or defendant, according to the legal right, as it on the whole appears. Stephens 144.
The plea of puis darrein continuance, we have already decided, is good; and next follows the replication. We think this is clearly a departure from the declaration. That sets forth the cause of action, and declares against Martha Ann Parkhill, administratrix of the estate, real and personal, which was of Samuel Parkhill, deceased. The replication sets out the order of the County Court, revoking and annulling the letters of administration to the said Martha Ann ; the appeal to Leon Superior Court by the said Martha Ann ; the affir-mance of the order of dismissal of the County Court by said Superior Court, and the delivery of the property of the estate of said Parkhill into the possession of the Marshal of the said Superior Court; that a receiver was duly appointed for said estate, till an administrator de bonis non was appointed by the County Court of Leon county; and that afterwards, on the twenty-second day of April, 1844, and before the filing of the said plea of the said defendants, Martha Ann and Hiram in this behalf, the County Court of Leon county did constitute and appoint the said Martha Ann, upon the petition of said Hiram and Martha Ann, an administratrix de bonis non of the estate of Samuel Parkhill, deceased.
The declaration is against her, in the capacity of administratrix simply; the replication, by setting forth the dismissal of the defendant as administratrix, and her appointment as administratrix de bonis non, is clearly a departure in pleading. It is inconsistent with the declaration, because the two capacities in which the defendant is charged, are, as has been already shown, inconsistent with each other — being in different rights, and distinct in every particular. It should fortify and maintain the matter in the declaration. It does not, and the allegation in that, and the replication, are in direct conflict. The plaintiff, by his replication, has shewn that he has no action against the defendant, (by admitting her dismissal as adminis-tratrix ;) and when this is the case, there shall be judgment for the defendant, though the bar be defective, for the Court will judge on the whole record. 6 Comyn’s Dig. (E 37,) page 137.
The rejoinder is not good — it is clearly a departure from the plea, and does not support it — it alledges neW matter inconsistent with the plea, and is defective. It is intended to answer the replication— they are both bad. It is unnecessary to set forth the reasons or grounds of this opinion — ''and the Court must go back to the first error or default.
■ There were several grounds assumed by the counsel on either side, involving the discussion of principles of great interest and importance ; but the Court have deemed it proper to notice only those which seemed to have a direct bearing upon, and tended to a direct decision of the cause.
The judgment must be reversed, with costs."
"Howse & Holloman vs. Mills Judson, et al.",1 Fla. 133,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Douglas, Chief Justice: .
This case comes before-us, upon a motion made by the counsel for the defendants in error to dismiss it, upon the ground that the plaintiffs in error have not authorised the institution of the suit; and that the writ of error was prayed for, and is now prosecuted, without their privity or consent.
The motion is based upon the following statement of facts, which has been agreed to by the counsel for the defendants in error, and the counsel of William Forbes, who prosecutes this writ of error, and which is of file with the papers of this cause, viz :
“ Judson & Co. obtained in the Gadsden Superior Court a judgment upon certiorari, against Howse & Holloman, which judgment, it is represented, is a lien upon certain real estate, subsequently purchased by one William Forbes, under a junior judgment, against one George W. Smith, the grantee of Howse & Holloman.
“ Forbes now sues out this writ of error, as a party injured by the judgment, and who is to be benefited by a reversal of the same.”
The question arising upon this state of facts is, “ Can he, Forbes, of his own right, in the name of Howse & Holloman, prosecute this writ of error.” We think he cannot. It is a well established principle of law, to which no exception can, ■ (it is believed,) be found, that “ no person can bring a writ of error to reverse a judgment, who was not a party, or privy to the record, or who was not injured by the judgment, and therefore to receive advantage by the reversal of it.” 1 Rob. Ab. 747. Dyer 90. There is nothing in this statement of facts, to show that Forbes was injured by this judgment, or even that he is (n danger of being so injured. For aught that appears, Howse & Holloman have ample means which may be reached by an execution, to satisfy the judgment, without resort being had to the real estate purchased by Forbes, as set forth in this statement of facts ; and it would be the duty of the plaintiff in execution, to exhaust all the other property of the defendants that can be thus reached, before resorting to such as they may have bona fide conveyed away, and which the purchaser shall have taken in good faith, and for which he shall have paid a valuable consideration, after the rendition of the judgment; and were the plaintiffs to attempt to act otherwise, a Court of Equity would restrain them ; for although a judgment is by law a lien upon the lands of the defendant, yet' ho may, after judgment, convey a good title to real estate, if he has at all times afterwards a sufficient amount of property, subject to, and within reach of an execution, to satisfy the judgment; otherwise a judgment for one thousand dollars, (or even a much less sum,) might lock up all the real estate which the defendant might own, although it were worth a million of dollars. But the law is not thus unreasonable. We do not perceive, therefore, how Forbes is prejudiced by this judgment; and a party cannot maintain error, when not prejudiced by the judgment. 5 Reports 38. Tomlin’s Law Dicty. Title Error 1. Hume vs. Long’s Representatives, 6 Monroe’s Reps. 118. Blight vs. McIlvoy, 4 Monroe’s Reps. 147. Nor can we see how he would be benefited by its reversal; and surely he can have no right to interfere, to prevent the plaintiffs below from making their money out of other property of the defendants, which would be the direct effect of this proceeding, and especially of such reversal, if they have such other property out of which the money can be made.
But the more important objection to this proceeding on the part of Forbes is, that he was not a party or privy to this judgment. He acquired his interest after it was rendered, and when he was bound to take notice of it. He is therefore a mere volunteer and does not stand iu such a relation to the judgment, as enables him to prosecute this writ of error, even if the real estate which he purchased as stated, is endangered by the lien which it creates.
The general rule being, that “none but parties to the record or privies can maintain a writ of error.” By privies are meant heirs, executors, administrators, terre tenants, those having an interest in remainder or reversion, or one who is made a party by the law, as he who comes in as a vouchee. 1 Rol. Ab. 748, 755. 1 Leon, 261,,

Forbes does not stand in either of the relations above mentioned, nor was he made a party by the law.
The motion is therefore sustained, and the case dismissed.
Per totam Curiam."
John D. Edwards vs. Union Bank of Florida,1 Fla. 136,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Douglas, Chief Justice:
This is an action of trespass, instituted by John D. Edwards against the Union Bank of Florida, in the Superior Court of Leon county, in the Middle District of Florida.
The declaration contains two counts. The first charges : “ That the said Union Bank of Florida, by its servants, officers and agents, on the sixteenth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, and on divers other days and times between that day, and before the commencement of this suit, with force and arms, &c., broke and entered divers, to wit: four closes of the said plaintiff, situated in Jefferson county, to wit: in the county aforesaid, and then and there broke down,” &c. — (setting out the other matters of the trespass in the usual form.)
The second: “ And for that also, the said defendant, by its officers, servants and agents aforesaid, on the days and years aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, impressed, seized, took, and carried away, divers, to wit: forty-one negro slaves, then and there being the servants, and in the possession of said plaintiff, and unlawfully kept and detained the said slaves, só being the servants of said plaintiff from and out of the service of said plaintiff, without the license or consent of said plaintiff, and against the will of said plaintiff; for a long space of time, to wit: until the commencement of this suit, whereby, &c. (the usual form in such cases), to the damage of said plaintiff of one hundred thousand dollars,” &c.
To this declaration, the defendant put in the plea of not guilty; upon which issue was joined, and that issue was submitted to a jury, who returned a verdict for plaintiff, and assessed his damages upon the first count at two thousand dollars; and upon the second at seventeen thousand dollars; making in the whole nineteen thousand dollars.
And thereupon the defendant, by its counsel, moved the Court for “ a rule nisi,” to arrest the judgment, for the reasons following, -to wit -
First: Because an action of “ trespass vi et armis,” doth not lie against a corporation.
Second: Because if such .an action can be maintained at all, it doth not lie in this case, the entry being warranted by law.
ThirdBecause the plaintiff has not, by law,' a right to a judgment in his favor.
Which rule was granted; and after argument had thereon, was by the consideration and judgment of said Court sustained; and the judgment upon said verdict was accordingly arrested.
Whereupon the said plaintiff, by his attorneys, prayed an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the Territory of Florida, which was granted accordingly, and the cause was carried up to the said Court of Appeals, whence it was transferred into this Court, under the provision contained in the last clause of the 17th article, (Schedule and Ordinance,) of the Constitution of the State, which declares that eCll actions at law, or suits in Chancery, or any other proceeding pending, or which may be pending in any Court of the Territory of Florida, may be commenced in, or transferred to such Court of the State, as may have jurisdiction of the subject matter thereof 5 andtff the provision contained in the 14th section of the act of the General Assembly of this State, of the 25th July, 1845, which was passed to carry into effect the above mentioned provision of the Constitution, so far as related to cases pending in the said Court of Appeals.
Upon the first day of the present term of this Court, a motion was made by the counsel for the Appellee, to dismiss this case, for the following reasons, viz:—
First: Because it has no rightful place in this Court; and this Court has no jurisdiction of the same, no appeal or writ of error having been sued out, or taken to this Court; and this Court1 having no appellate jurisdiction of the case.
Second: Because the judgment of the Leon Superior Court is fi. nal, until reversed by the proper appellate tribunal, constituted by the acts of Congress of the United States.
Third: Because this Court has appellate jurisdiction only over those inferior Courts, which the Constitution of the State of Florida has established, and which compose, with this Court, the judiciary power of the State.
Which last motion was overruled, for the reasons given in the opinion of the Court, pronounced by Judge Baltzell, on a former day of this term, in the case of Charles-D. Stewart vs. Thomas Preston, jr., upon a similar motion, founded upon the same reasons as the motion to dismiss this case.
After which, the counsel for the appellant filed herein the following assignment of errors, to wit: — ■
First: The Court erred in sustaining the motion in arrest of judgment.
Second: The Court erred in giving judgment for defendant, and not for plaintiff.
Which errors we now proceed to examine. From this state of the case, we are first called upon to inquire, whether trespass vi et armis lies against a corporation ?
It is said, in some of the old books, that trespass does not lie against a corporation, because a capias and exigent does not go against a corporation. But an exigent was never known in practice in Florida, and the capias has long since been virtually banished from it, in all civil cases, by the provision contained in the last clause of the fifth section of'the act to amend an act regulating judicial proceedings, approved November 23d, 1828, which declares that no person shall be required to give bail for his or her appearance, to any original writ or summons, emanating from a Court of Law; and the fifty-third section of the same act, Duval’s Comp, page 99, by which it is declared: “ That in no case shall a capias ad sat-isfaciendum be issued by the Clerk, upon judgment of the Court— nor shall the body of any defendant be subject to arrest or confinement, for the payment of money, except it be for fines imposed by lawful authority ;” — so that, neither a capias or exigent ever issued in an action against a corporation in this State in any case. “ Ces-sante ratione, cessat et ipsa lex.” But it is believed, that the position thus stated, is laid down more broadly than was ever warranted by the principles of the common law. It was held, at an early period in England, that, “ a corporation might be defendants in an action of quare impedit, and the hindrance is an act of tort.” And the case of Butler vs. the Bishop of Hereford and the University of Cambridge, Barnes C. P. 350, is cited by Lord , Ellenborough in the case of Yarborough vs. the Bank of England, 8 East. Reps. 9, to this point: “ To which he says, a multitude of other instances may be added, as Rost. 497, 2 Mod. En. 291. Winch. 625—700—721. 2 Lut. 1100, and 3 Lev.. 332. The statute of 9 Henry the 4th, chap. 5, recites the practice in assizes of novel “ disseisin,” and other pleas of land, of naming the mayor, and bailiffs, and commonalty of a franchise, as disseisors, in order to oust them of holding plea thereof; and directs the inquiry before the Judges of assize, whether they be disseisors or tenants, or be named by fraud;”— which most clearly proves, that they may be considered as disseisors. And there are instances of trespasses against corporations, in 44 Ed. 3d. 2 Pl. 5, which was after 22 Ass. PI. 67, cited in the argument of the case of Yarborough vs. the Bank of England. Trespass, says Lord Ellenborough, was brought against the mayor and commonajty of Hull, and another person; and the objection was made, not that trespass would not lie against the corporation, but as a natural person was joined with them;, there must be different processes. A distress against the former, and a capias against the latter. But the objection does not appear to have prevailed — and in 8 Hen. 6, 1—14, trespass was brought against the mayor, bailiffs and commonalty, and one of the commonalty; and the objection was, not that trespass would not lie against the corporation, but- that it could not be supported against them, and an individual of their body. And Bro. on Corporations PI. 24, says, the.better opinion was, that the writ was good ; and 14th Hen. 8th, 2, says it was so awarded, and that in that case, all the justices agreed. The case of Yarborough vs. the Bank of England, was decided on the principle, that actions of tort, without distinction, would lie against corporations. Lord Ellenbo-rough, who delivered the opinion of the Court of King’s Bench, cited several cases, (some of which we have already cited,) in which trespass had been maintained, in very early times, against corporations, under circumstances which preclude the idea or inference that an objection to the form of the action was then considered maintainable. His own opinion was, that trespass had been, and might be maintained; and that the want of authority, under the corporate seal, to do the act complained of, was not material. Both Viner & Comyn, it is true, speak of the law as settled, that trespass lies not against a corporation aggregate. Both assign the same reason, viz: that capias and exigent do not lie; and cite Brown on Corporations. Thealal & Thorpe’s Assizes.
In Riddle vs. the proprietors of the locks and canals on the Merrimack river, 7 Mass. Reps. 186 — 8, although an action for a non-feasance, Parsons, Chief Justice, entered fully, and very ably, into this question, and shows, upon the authority of Thealal himself, the principal reference of Viner & Comyn, that Thorpe’s opinion, which has been so much relied on, had been overruled in England, as to certain trespasses; and takes what we deem the true and correct distinction, between corporations of a public nature, called quasi corporations, such as towns, cities, &c., and proper corporations .aggregate, by which is meant money, and business corporations, against which the action may, (and we think sound policy requires should,) be maintained.
In the case of Chesnut Hill, &c., Turnp. Co. vs. Rutter, 4 Serg. & Rawle, Rep. 6, which was an action of trespass on the case for stopping a water course, it was strongly objected, that a corporation could not be guilty of a tort; but Chief Justice Tillman said, that this doctrine was fallacious in principle, and mischievous in its consequences, as it tends to introduce actual wrongs, and ideal remedies; for a Turnpike Company might do great injury, by means of laborers having no property to answer damages recovered against them ; that it was much more reasonable to say, that where a corporation is authorised by law to make a road, if any injury is done in the course of making that road by the persons employed under its authority, it shall be responsible in the same manner as an individual is responsible for the acts of his servants touching his business, and “ there is no solid ground for a distinction between contracts and torts.” Angeli & Ames on corporations, 224, 226, is also authority to this point. And Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Towle vs. The Common Council of Alexandria, 3d. Peters’ Rep. 409, lays it down as well settled, “ that money corporations, or those carrying on business for themselves, are liable for tortsnot of particular description only, but torts generally committed by their agents. In the case of John Whitemongs Ex. vs. The Wilmington and Susquehanna Rail Road Company, 2 Harrington’s Rep. 514, it was held, that “trespass will lie against a corporation,” and in the case of Dater vs. Troy Turnpike and Rail Road Co. 2 Hills N. Y. Rep. 632, Cowen, Justice, said, “the old doctrine always admitted to be questionable, (1 Kyd on Corporations 223,) that trespass or ejectment will not lie against a corporation, is exploded by modern authorities,” and in the case of the second Precinct, in Rebobath vs. The Cath. Cong. Church and Society in Rebobath, 23 Pickerings Rep. 140, the Court remarked, “it is said that an aggregate corporation cannot commit a disseisin unless the entry be authorised by their deed; and so, if a corporation be disseised, the entry to revest their estate must be by an authority under seal. This, says the Court, was undoubtedly the ancient doctrine as to corporations, but a more liberal doctrine has long since prevailed, and as the law now is, corporations may be bound by implication from corporate acts without a vote or deed, and the cases of the Canal Bridge vs. Gorden, 1 Pickering Rep. 297, and Episcopal Charitable Society vs. Episcopal Chuch in Dedham, 1 Pickerings Rep. 372, are cited.
So trover or assumpsit, or trespass, will lie against a corporation as against a natural person. Fostor vs. Essex Bank, 17 Mass. Rep. 503. So a town or Parish may. acquire a title by disseisin, by an exclusive adverse occupation, although the occupation was not authorized by any writing under seal, Milton vs. First Parish in Milton, 10 Pickering’s Rep. 452, and it is not a little remarkable, that the case of Bloodgood vs. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company, which was an action of trespass, Quare Clausum Fregit, and is first found in 14 Wendell’s Rep. 51, and again in 18 Wendell’s Rep. 9, should have passed through all the Courts of the State of New York, without objection as to the form of the action, if (as is contended,) such an action doth not lie against a corporation. Indeed it is strong evidence, that both the bar and the Courts of that great and enlightened State, consider, as did the late venerable Chief Justice Marshall, that it is well settled, “ that money corporations, or those carrying on business for themselves, are liable for torts, committed by their ser-vanfs or agents in the course of théir business.” ^ And in view of all these high authorities, we feel-ourselves constrained so to regard it. If however this point was left in doubt by the general current of authority, our statute, directing the mode of instituting suits against corporations, Duval’s Comp. 104, the first section of which provides, “ that in all cases actions, or suits -which' may be instituted against any corporation, instead of the process heretofore (used to compel, the appearance of such corporation,-it shall'bo sufficient to .issue ‘a sum mons’ to- the Marshal or other proper officer, (now the Sheriff,) reciting the cause of. action, and summoning the said corporation to appear and answer the same on the proper return day,” &c., should be permitted to settle the question.
This brings us to the second reason-assigned for arresting thejudg, ment which was, “that'if such an action could.be maintained at all, it doth not lie in this case, the entry being warranted by law.” It is a sufficient' answer to this position to say, that there appears to be nothing in the record to sustain it, and after ave'rdict against the’ defendants upon the only issue in the case, upon the plea of not guilty, it comes too late. The third and last reason assigned was that the plaintiff, had not by law a right to a judgment in his favor. This is very general, as is also the last error assigned, viz: “ that the Court erifed in giving judgment for the defendant,” but it is under this third reason, that the appellee urges the want of jurisdiction in the’ Superior Court of Leon County to try this case. The cause of action, it is- alleged, (if any was committed,) was committed in Jefferson County ; that the cause of action is local not transitory, and could not therefore -be rightfully instituted or tried in Leon County. It is very curious and instructive, says a late writer upon this subject, (who seems to have examined it extensively and with considerable ability,) to trace the progress of the English law respecting the locality of actions. During the earliest ages of our judicial history, juries were selected for the very reasons which would now argue their unfitness, videlicit their personal acquaintance with the parties, and the merits of the cause. And few rules of law were enforced- with greater strictness than those which required the venue, visne or vicemm, or in other words the neighborhood’ whence the jurors were to be summoned, should be also that in which the cause of action had arisen, in order thát the jury, who were to determine it, principally from-their own private knowledge, and who were liable to be attainted, if they delivered a wrong verdict, .might be persons likely to be acquainted with the nature of the transaction which they were called upon to try. In order to effect this end, the parties litigant, were required to state in their pleadings, with the utmost certainty, not merely the county, but the very venue, i. e. the very district .hundred or mile within that county, where the facts» that they alleged had taken place,' in order that the Sheriff might'be'directed to summon thé Jury from the proper neighborhood,1 in case issue should be taken on any such allegations. It followed of course, that a new venue was designated, as often as the parties litigant shifted.the scene of the transaction from one part' of the county to another. This was however soon found to produce great inconvenience, for in mixed transactions, which may happen partly in one place and partly in another, it was extremely difficult to ascertain the right venue, and as the number of these transactions multiplied with increasing civilization, these difficulties about determining the place of trial became numerous and of constant occurrence, ánd soon induced the Courts to take a distinction between transitory matters, such as contracts which might happen any where, and local ones, such as trespass to the. realty, which could Only happen in one particular place, and regulations Were adopted respecting- transitory actions, and from time to time changed, and modified to suit the exigencies of the times, (which it is not necessary for us now to notice.) Bjut where a matter alleged in pleading, was of a local description, whether the allegation-happened in a declaration orín any subsequent pleading, the venue for the trial of such matter could be no where but at the very place,where it was alleged in pleading to have happened, and therefore even in cases the most' transitory, if the cause of action was laid'in'London, and there was a local justification as at Oxford, the cause must have been tried in Oxford, not in London. Ford vs. Brook, Croke Eliz. 261. Bower’s case Moor. 410. “ And it was probably this strictness of the law with regard to venue* which rendered it necessary to confine the defendant so long to a single pl#a, since had he pleaded several pleas on which issues had been taken triable by different venues, there could have been no single trial of the action, and accordingly we find that it was not till after the effect of the statute of 16 and 17 Car. 2, on venues, had become well settled, that the very same year'whi'ch put an end to the last remnant of the old severity, by abolishing the necessity of summoning hundredors, also endowed the defendant with a right which he ought in justice always to have possessed, of stating every thing in his defence, which can by law be made available to exonerate him; the right corresponding to which, that namely of replying to- the de-fence, every thing which has a direct tendency to rebut it, is even in our more advanced times denied the plaintiff.” 1 Smith’s leading cases 481, in note. -Thus stood the law in England in regard to local actions, and defences at the time of the passage of the'act of 16 and 17 Car. 2, Cap. 8, concerning venues, (one of the statutes of Jeo-fails,) which declared, “ that after verdict,' judgment should not be stayed or reversed, for that there is no right venue, áo as the cause were tried by a jury of the proper county, or place where the action is laid.” 1 Chitty’s PI; 279-283. Considerable difficulty arose on the construction of this statute, many lawyers contending that the words, “ the proper county or place where the action is laid,” must be understood to mean the proper, county or place, where the issue arises, so that if the issue arose at Dale in Oxfordshire, and the venue was Sale in the same county, here they ■ said was a case within the same statute, there being a right county, but a wrong venue. But it was at length decided in the case of Craít vs. Boite, 1 Saund. 246, that the words, “ where the action was laid,” mean where it was laid in the declaration, not in any subsequent pleading; and accordingly it has ever since been held, that it is sufficient-if the jury be summoned from the venue laid in the declaration. 1- Smith’s Leading cases 482 in note. In local actions, the only modes of objecting to the venue are by demurrer. Thrale vs. Cornwall, 1 Wilson 165, or at the trial as a ground of nonsuit. The Mayor, &c., of London vs. Cole et al. 7 Term Rep. 588.- Stevenson vs. Lambafd, 2 East 580. Brackshaw vs. Hopkins, Cowp. 410. Soutler vs. Heard, 2 Bla. Rep. 1033. In local actions, if the venue be laid in the wrong County, and the'objection appear upon the record, it is clear, that the defendant may demur. 1 Saunders 241. The Mayor, &c., of Berwick vs. Ewart, 2 Bla. Rep. 1070. Mellon vs. Barber, 3 Term Rep. 387; and if it do not appear on the record, he may under the general issue avail himself of the objection at the trial, as the ground of nonsuit. 1 Chitty’s PI. 284-285.
It is contended, on behalf of the appellee, that the case meant in the statute of 16 and 17 Car. 2, would be this r If the defendant were sued in this case in Jefferson county, and the action tried there, and the venue laid in the declafation was “ Leon county, ss.,” and ’a number of cases were cited by his counsel in support-of this position. As this is á very material point in this case, we have bestowed upon it that anxious attention, which the important bearing that it has upon the issue in this case demands., But after the most careful examination of the question, and the authorities presented upon it, we cannot assent to that proposition. To our minds, it seems to be at variance with the current of authorities on the subject. The case of Crafts vs. Boite, 1 Saunders 387 to 389, first settled the true and proper construction of the statute of the 16 and 17 Car. 2. In the case ef the Mayor, &c., of London vs. Cole, 7 Term Reps. 583—584, Lord Kenyon, Ch. J., delivering the opinion of the Court, and speaking of the statute of 16 and 17 Car. 2, said: “I cannot express myself in better terms than Kelynge, Chief Justice, and Rainesford and Moreton, Justices, did, in one of the cases cited, who said the words of the statute are plain, that the issue was tried by a jury of the proper county where the action was brought, which was within the express words of the statute, and, (as they conceived,) within the intent of the statute.” The one of the cases cited, as mentioned by Lord Kenyon, was that of Craft vs. Boite, 1 Saunders, 337, 339, by which the true and correct construction of this statute was first settled. In note 3, at page 339 of this book, it is said: The judgment in this case was at first received with considerable disapprobation ; and Lander vs. Elliott, Camb. p. 75, is cited to sustain the remark ; the better opinion being, (says the annotator,) that the intent of the statute was, to aid a wrong venue in the same county, where the issue arose, and not a wrong county, according to the distinction made by Saunders. However, (he adds,) the subsequent decisions are conformable hereto; and 2 Lev. 164 — 165. Adderly vs. Wise, Vent. 263. Jennings vs. Hanking, S. C. 2 Lev. 121. 3 Keble, 509. Sir T. Raymond, 292. Horton vs. Nausan, 3 Lev. 394, (Hunt’s case, and Briggs vs. Chew, there cited.) 1 Lord Raym. 330. Sir Richard Leving vs. Lady Claverly, S. C. Cooth. 448. 2 Lord Raymond, 1212. Maitland vs. Taylor, and 7 Term Rep. 583. The Mayor of London vs. Cole, are cited as “ the subsequent decisions conformable thereto.” In Comyn’s Digest, 260, it is said: “ If a local action be brought and tried in a wrong county, the defect is aided after verdict, by statute 16 and 17 Car. 2, C. 8.
The general issue was pleaded in this case; the cause was tried in the Superior Court, and by a jury of Leon county, where the action was brought. As the land upon which the trespass was committed, is shown by the declaration to be situated in Jefferson county, the defendant might have demurred; had it not been thus shown, it might have availed him on a motion to rule out the. testimony, as to the count in “ quare clausum fregit.” This is in accordance with the principle upon which the case of McKenna vs. Fiske, 17 Peters Rep. 245 to 250, was decided. This was an action of trespass, brought by the plaintiff in error against the defendant, in the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, for the recovery of damages, for a large amount of goods and chattels, rights and credits, and personal property, taken and detained, and destroyed by. the defendant. The declaration contained two counts, one for trespass to personal chattels,- the other was; for “ quare clausum' fregit” in the ;county of Washington. On the trial, the plaintiff offered to prove that the defendant, with a large force, of armed men, came to the store house or shantee of the plaintiff, in Alleghany county, iii the State of Maryland, entered into the same, and -took and carried away the goods and chattels stated in the declaration, &6.; and other, evidence was offered to show the value of the goods, The Court refused to-permit thevevidence to go to the jury. Upon’ an exception to this ruling, the case was carried up to the Supreme Court of the United States, which, although it held that, the evidence'offered, as( to the local count, was not competent, yet sustained the exception taken by the plaintiff, to the ruling of the Court, below, in regard to the evidence excluded, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. And see also, 1 Chitty’s PI. 264.
In the case before us, no objection was made to the -reception of the evidence in the Court below, on either count. ' The jury found for the plaintiff. The defect is cured by the statute of 16 and 17 Car. 2, before cited. The Court, therefore, erred in arresting the judgment upon it.
It was intimated, (but not strongly urged,) by the counsel for the appellant, that our'statute of Jeoiail, which is found in the act above referred to, regulating judicial proceedings, of 23d November, 1828, is that of 32 Henry 8, chap. 30,< sec. 1, and not that of 16 and 17 Car'. 2; and a doubt was expressed, whether the last mentioned statute is in force in this' State — -but the act of November 6th, 1829, entitled, an “ act providing for the adoption of the common and statute laws of England,” &c., which was passed one year after the judicial act, declared that the‘common and statute law of England, which are of-a general, and not of a local nature, with certain exceptions, (none of which include the statute of 16 and 17 Car. 2,) should-be of force in the Territory of Florida. Duv. Com. 357. This act is continued, and made of force in this State, by the 17th article, (Schedule and Ordinance,) of our Constitution.
Hitherto, we have been considering this question, without reference to the act directing the mode of instituting suits against Corporations, before referred to upon another subject — the second section of which provides: — “ That if any summons be issued against any banking, rail road, insurance or.incorporated company, service on the president' or other head, or in hisabsence, on the cashier .or treasurer; or in the absence oí both the president or chief officer, and the cashier or treasurer, then on any director of such company; such president or other chiei officer, cashier, treasurer, or director, being, at the time of service, within the county in which he usually resides, shall be deemed sufficient service of the sajd process.” This act was approved February 11th, 1834. See Duval’s Comp. 104 — 105. The object of this latter provision, (“ such president, &c., being at the time of such service, within the county in which he usually resides,”) is certainly not very clear. But it is difficult to imagine any reason for it, unless it be, that the Legislature contemplated such residence to be in the county where the office of such company should be kept, and intended the trial to take place in that county, thereby bringing such corporations within, (if they were not already so,) the provisions of the 10th section of the judicial act above mentioned, by which it is declared: “ That no suit should be brought to any of the Superior Courts of the Territory, against any person residing therein, Unless the same be instituted in the judicial district and county in which the defendant resides.”
By the first section of the “ act to incorporate the subscribers to the Union Bank of Florida” — Duval’s Comp. 442 — it is provided : “ That a bank shall be established in the city of Tallahassee, under the title of the ‘Union Bank of Florida,’ ” &c. The Court may take judicial notice that Tallahassee is in Leon county, (where the venue in this case was laid, and where this cause was tried,) that being the place where, by law, the Courts for this county are required to be holden. This suit was instituted in that Court, and fit may well be doubted whether, under the- peculiar provisions of the statutes referred to, it could properly have been brought in any other. The distinction upon which the question under discussion is based, is purely technical. This was so held by Chief Justice Marshal, in the case of Livingston vs. Jefferson, 2 Brock. Rep. 203, (cited at the bar,) and from the terms in which he expressed himself in delivering his opinion in that case, it appears quite evident that he would gladly have seized upon any statutory regulation, which could, with propriety, have been construed to abolish the distinction between local and transitory actions, especially that class of them in which possession of real estate is not the object of the suit, and where the redress sought is only in damages. In that case the ""objection was taken by demurrer.
It seems to have been the intention of the Legislature to abolish this distinction, by the statutes cited to this point. Whether that be the effect of these statutes or not, this Court is clearly of opinion, that they confer upon the defendant, in cases like the present, the privilege of having any cause tried in the county where he resides, which the plaintiff may bring against him there ; and that, after verdict, it is too late for him to object that it was tried in the wrong county. No objection was taken to the locality of the action in the Court below, and for the causes stated, such objection cannot be taken now.
The judgment of the Court below, must be reversed, with costs; and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court of Leon county, for further proceedings, in accordance with this opinion.
Per- totam curiam."
William D. Moseley and the Executor of Jesse H. Willis vs. John S. Shepherd,1 Fla. 155,1846-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baltzem., Justice:
Two rules were taken in the Court below,' by different counsel,"" against John G, Camp, as follows: . ""
Jessse H. Willis, 1 vs. >
Lamb, Ex’r of Gatlin, dec’d. ) And now, on this 28th"" day of A* pril, 1845, on motion of Thompson & Hagner, of counsel for plaintiff, it is ordered, that John G. Camp, Esq., Marshal of the Middle Bis-trict, do show cause on to-morrow morning, why he should not pay over to the plaintiff in this execution, the moneys arising from the sale of the mules, and corn and fodder, sold on the 1st Monday of January last, as the property of the estate of Gatlin, under and by executions in his hands, against the executors of said estate.
The other rule- is entitled :
W. D. Moseley, 1 Ex’rs of Gatlin. )
And was made by J. & L. O’B. Branch, counsel for plaintiff, and is in other respects a copy of the former.
The Marshal, in return to this writ, says: “ He returns into Court the executions, No. 2887, &c., respectively issued at the suit of the Union Bank of Florida, against the executors of Gatlin, together with certain papers, and that he did, on the 16th May, 1844, levy upon said mules, corn and fodder, by virtue of said executions, and made sale thereof, to satisfy the same. That he"" holds the proceeds for the use and benefit of the assignee of the plaintiff in said suits respectively. All which he submits.”
Afterwards, on a day- which does not appear, the following order was made:
Jesse H. Willis, L. G. Lamb, Ex’r of Gatlin. Wm. D. Moseley, J j n The rule upon the Marshal, J. G. Camp. . vs. The same.
This day came, as well the plaintiff in the above executions, as John S. Shepherd, assignee of the Union Bank of Florida, plaintiff in the several executions returned by the Marshal with his answer, by their respective attorneys; and the Court, having fully heard the evidence and argument of counsel, doth order and adjudge, that the moneys arising from the sales of the mules, and corn, and fodder, sold on the first Monday in January last, by the Marshal, properly belong, and are applicable to the executions in favor of the Union Bank of Florida,'against A. M. Gatlin’s Executors, respectively, and therefore the Court discharges the said rules, with costs. From which order and judgment of the said Court, the said Jesse H. Willis and W. D. Moseley, prayed an appeal, which is granted them, upon their entering into bond, in the sum of one hundred dollars, conditioned for payment of costs and damages, on failure to prosecute their appeal with effect.
An appeal bond was executed and given, to the effect as follows;
Know all men by these presents, that we, Jesse. H, Willis, Wm. D. Moseley, are held and firmly bound unto John S. Shepherd, in the just and full sum of one hundred dollars, &c.
The condition is such that, whereas, on the 8th of May, 1845, in the matter of a rule on John G. Camp, Marshal, issued at the instance of said Jesse H. Willis and W. D. Moseley, the said Court considered, that the moneys arising from certain sales of personal property, belonged to sundry executions, wherein Union Bank of Florida, for the use of John S. Shepherd, assignee, is plaintiff, and the executors of A. M. Gatlin are defendants; and thereupon dismissed said rule, from which said Willis and Moseley appealed to the Court of Appeals. If, therefore, the said Willis and Moseley shall pay ihe costs and damages, &c., then the'obligation was to be void. ' • *
A motion is made to dismiss this appeal, on the ground that it was irregularly taken.
Without adverting to the fact, that the bond is not made payable to Camp, the party to the suit, and against whom the rule was taken, it is sufficient, in the opinion of the Court, that the interests of these parties are separate, and that they cannot legally unite in a joint appeal bond. The rule is in the nature of a suit; and if these cases had been commenced by writ and declaration, they must have presented separate and distinct interests and rights. The dismissal of them by one order, in no sense makes them joint, or a joint judgment. Properly speaking, and in strictness, there should have been a separate order in each case ; but for brevity, as the same order may apply to several cases, their incorporation together has been permitted in practice, where the object of the Court could be equally attained by it. If the decision of the Court had been different, and for plaintiffs below, a separate order would have been requisite and indispensable. If the parties had succeeded, the judgment of the Court would have been, to pay to each the sum to which he might be found entitled, and his costs; and such would be the judgment of this Court, if the parties succeeded here upon their rules. In this latter event there would be two separate judgments in a common law case, and in favor of different parties, having distinct and opposing interests, which cannot, in our opinion, be according to the rules of law.
As the judgment of dismissal, stands now in the Court below, we are of opinion that separate executions ought to issue against each of the parties, for the costs in that Court.
The appeal will therefore be dismissed, with costs."

This suit was instituted by the Union Bank of Florida, in the Superior Court of Leon county, in the Middle District of Florida, against Martha Ann Manley, administratrix, and Hiram Manley, administrator in right of his wife, of the lands and tenements, goods and chattels, rights, and credits, and effects, which were of Samuel Parkhill, late of Leon county, deceased, by petitioner, under the act of the Legislative Council of the late Territory of Florida, approved Dec. 11th, 1824, entitled, An act to regulate the foreclosure of mortgages by the Courts of Common law of this Territory, and for other purposes,” for the purpose of foreclosing two mortgages, given by the said Samuel Parkhill in his life time, to said Union Bank, the first bearing date the 6th day oi November, 1839, on twenty slaves, with the future issue and increase of the female slaves, to secure the payment of a certain bill of exchange for twenty-five thousand dollars, dated August 29, 1839, drawn upon Hamilton & Co., of New York, at ninety days after date, payable to and endorsed by William H. Brodie; — the second bearing date the 19th day of October, 1840, made and executed by the said Samuel Parkhill, to the petitioner, on the same twenty slaves, set forth in the mortgage of 6th November, 1839, and on twenty-two other slaves, together with the future issue and increase of the females, which said last mentioned mortgage was intended to secure the payment of the following debts, viz r — 1. A certain bill of exchange, dated 29th August, 1839, payable 90 days after the 4th of November, 1839, drawn on Hamilton & Co., of New York, in favor of William H. Brodie, for twenty-five thousand dollars, credited by endorsements, with the sum of $9,350, Feb. 22d, 1840, and which is, (stated in the notice given to said Martha Ann Manley and Hiram Manley, to be,) the same bill specified in the mortgage of the 6th Nov. 1839. 2. A note of said Samuel, payable to the order of John Parkhill, cashier, dated 28th August, 1839, at 90 days after 24th Oct. 1839, for twenty thousand dollars, credited by endorsements, July 18th, 1840, by the sum of $3923 58-100 dollars. 3. A bill of exchange, dated Feb. 8th, 1837, drawn by William H. Brodie, ,on Hamilton & Cole, New York, in favor of, and endorsed by said Samuel, for the sum of ten thousand five hundred dollars. 4. A certain note of said Samuel, dated 24th April, 1839, in favor of and endorsed by William P. Craig, for fifteen thousand dollars, payable eight months after its date, credited 21st January, 1840, with the sum of $10,000, and on 1st January, 1840, with'the sum of $1099 35-100. 5. A bill of exchange, dated March 22d, 1837, drawn by William P. Craig, in favor of and endorsed by said Samuel, on Maitland, Kennedy & Co., New York, at 4 months date, for the sum of five thousand two hundred dollars. 6. A promissory note of the said Samuel, dated Jan. 4, 1840, payable to and endorsed by R. H. Berry, at ninety days after its date, for fourteen hundred and forty-three 58-100 dollars. 7. A note of the said Samuel, dated Jan. 10, 1840, payable to and endorsed by John Parkhill, at ninety days, for the sum of six thousand dollars. 8. A promissory note of the said Samuel, dated 18th March, 1840, payable sixty days after date, to and endorsed by William P. Craig, for ten thousand dollars. 9. A promissory note of the said Samuel, dated Jan. 19th, 1840, payable 90 days after its date, to the order of, and endorsed by John Parkhill, for five thousand dollars. 10. A promissory note of the said Samuel, dated Feb. 1, 1840, payable ninety days after its date, to and endorsed bj Jo'hn Parkhill, for five thousand dollars. 11. And a promissory note of the said Samuel, dated October 19, 1840, payable to the said Union Bank of Florida, or its assigns, on demand, for thirteen thousand two hundred dollars. Which said several sums were, by the terms of the last mentioned mortgage, to be paid in and by the following instalments, viz:— Twenty-five thousand dollars on or before the first day of April, in the year 1841, and fifteen thousand dollars annually thereafter, on or before the first day of April, in each succeeding year, until the whole of said debts, with the interest thereon, should have been duly paid and discharged. The - petition sets forth the death of Samuel Park-hill ; the grant of letters of administration, upon the'goods and estate, which were of the said Samuel, at the time of his death, to his widow, Martha Ann Parkhill; her intermarriage with the said Hiram Manley ; alledges that the first, second and third instalments, mentioned and specified in the mortgage last set forth, were due and unpaid; and that the same, with the interest due thereon, amounted to the sum of #64,049 99-100; and prayed judgment for the said debt, and foreclosure of the equity of redemption, in the usual form, and for further relief, &c.'
Personal service of notice was given, on the 20th of February, 1844, to Martha Ann Manley, administratrix, and Hiram Manley, administrator as aforesaid, of the intention of the Union Bank of Florida, to institute this suit, agreeable to the provisions of the act above referred to, and that it would, on the fourth Monday in April then next, move the Court for a decree of foreclosure, &c., according to the prayer of the petition. On the 3d day of the ensuing month of May, said Martha Ann and Hiram Manley filed a plea, alledging in substance that, after the commencement of this suit, to wit: — on the 22d day of March, 1844, in the county aforesaid, they were dismissed from the administration of the estate of the said Samuel Parkhill, by competent authority, to wit: — by the Judge of the Superior Court of said county, sitting as an appellate Court, &c. To this plea, there was a special demurrer filed by the counsel for the petitioner, and this plea and demurrer remain undisposed of upon the record. This plea and demurrer, it is alledged by the counsel for the petitioner, was missing at the time of the trial of this cause in the Court below; and as that fact is understood to have been conceded by the counsel for the appellants, and there seems to be some difference of opinion between the counsel for the respective parties, as to-the fact whether they were noticed and considered of record, during the argument of this cause in the Court below, and are not deemed material to a decision of the case, we pass them without further notice. On the 4th day of the same month of May, the administrators, Manley and wife, as appears by the record, asked leave to file additional pleas; and the Court so allowed, and continued the cause.
The petitioner then suggested the appointment, by the Court of Leon county, of William D. Moseley, together with the defendant, Martha Ann Manley, administrator de bonis non of said estate; and moved the Court that the said William D. Moseley, administrator de bonis non, be made a party to the said suit, and the suit continue, as well against the defendants, as against the said William D. Moseley, and the same was done accordingly. On the 18th day of July, 1844, the said defendants, Martha Ann Manley and Hiram Manley, sued as administratrix and administrator of Samuel Parkhill, deceased, filed certain additional and amended pleas, (nineteen in number,) to the said petition;
On the day of November, 1844, the copy of the order of the 4th May, 1844, with the Marshal’s return thereon, was filed; which copy and return is in these words: “In Leon Superior Court.” “ The Union Bank of Florida vs. administrators of Sam’l Parkhill.” “ On Petition ofForeclosure of Mortgage.”
The petitioner, by his counsel, moved for judgment and decree, by default, no objections having been filed under the statute, the plea of Hiram Manley and Martha Ann Parkhill, administrators, filed on the 3d day of May, 1844, not being verified by affidavit. But the Court overruled the motion; and the petitioner then filed his demurrer, (special,) to said plea. The administrators, Manley and wife, then asked leave to file additional pleas; and the Court so allowed and continued the case. The petitioner then suggested the appointment, by the County Court of Leon county, of William D. Moseley, together with the defendant, Martha Ann Manley, administrator de bonis non of said estate ; and moved the Court that the said William D. Moseley, administrator de bonis non, be made a party to the said suit; and the suit continue, as well against the defendants, as against the said William D. Moseley; and the same is done accordingly. .

On the 4th day of November, 1844, the petitioner, by his counsel, gave notice that he would' move the Court to strike out sundry pleas, eighteen in .number, heretofore filed by Martha Ann Manley, late Parkhill, and Hiram Manley, sued as administratrix and administrator of Samuel Parkhill, deceased, filed in July last, for the reasons following: .
1. Because said pleas are not properly entitled, in this — that they are entitled in a cause of Martha Ann'Manley, (late Parkhill,) and Hiram Manley, sued as administratrix and administrator of Samuel Parkhill, deceased, at the suit of the Union Bank of Florida, upon petition for foreclosure of mortgage,"" and for judgment, &c. Whereas, the said pleas upon the said-petition of the Union Bank of Florida, toughtohave been entitled, in the cause upon said pétition, wherein the Union Bank of Florida is petitioner, against Martha Ann Manley and William D. Moseley, administrators de bonis non,, of Samuel Park, hill, deceased, as the same is now pending in Leon Superior Court.
2d. Andas to the said pleas, firstly, secondly, thirdly, and si*-teenthly: Because the same are not sworn to, as directed by the statute in such case made and provided.
And on Monday, Dec. 30th,, 1844, the Court having considered the • motion theretofore made in this case, to strike out sundry pleas filed by Martha Ann Manley, (late Parkhill,) and Hiram Manley, on the 18th day of July (then) last: Ordered, that the said pleas be stricken out, unless the said Manley and wife should rightly entitle said pleas, numbered 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,12, 13,■ 14, 15,'17 and 18, in the case pending against the administrators de bonis non of Samuel Parkhill, deceased. • '
And it was further ordered, that the pleas No. 1, 2, 3 and 16, be absolutely stricken out, because the samé are not sworn to; and thereupon the defendants, by their counsel, amended the title to their said several pleas, to read as follows, viz: “ The Union Bank of Florida vs. Martha A; Manley, in her own, right, and Hiram Manley, in right of his wife, Martha .Ann, together with William D. Moseley, impleaded administrators de bonis non ofSamuel Parkhill, deceased.” On the 31st day of December, 1844, the petitioner, by it’s attorneys, filed general demurrers to the sixth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth pleas, as above pleaded; and special demurrers to the ninth, fifteenth and seventeenth .of said pleas;. to which the defendants joined; and the Court, after, argument, sustained said demurrers, and rendered .judgment for costs thereon, against the said defendants ; and on motion of the petitioner,, ordered that the eighteenth ^and nineteenth pleas should be stricken out ;,and' the same was done accordingly. Whereupon the said defendants, Mirtha Ann. and Hiram, asked leave of the Court to amend their ninth” plea; which was granted, and the same was amended accordingly. • And thereupon the petitioner, by it’s counsel, filed its replications to the several pleas of the said Martha Ann and Hiram, 4, 5; 7, 8, 9 and 14, above pleaded; and issue was joined to'all the said replications, except'the one filed to the said 8th plea, to which last, replication the counsel for the clefendant filed their demurrer; to which the petitioner, by it’s counsel, joined, and after .argument had there on, the Court overruled said last mentioned demurrer. The issues joined upon the 4, 5, 7, 9. and-14th pleas, wore.submitted to a jury, at.the Fall-Term of the Leon Superior Court — who returned a verdict upon all the issues joined, to wit: — upon the issue's joined upon the 4, 5, 7, 9 and 14th píeas; but without stating any amount or sum. in their verdict.
. 'And thereupon the following decree and judgment of foreclosure, was entered in said caiise; viz“ Middle District of Florida. “ In Leon Superior Court, at Fall Term, 1844. “ The Union Bank of Florida, petitioner, vs. Martha Ann Manley, (late Parkhill,) in her own right, and Hiram Manley, in right of his .wife Martha Ann, and William D. Moseley, administrators de bonis non of Samuel Park-hill, deceased, defendants.”
,"" “ And now at this day came, as well the -petitioner, by it’s attorneys, as’the said defendants, Martha Ann and Hiram, by their attorneys ; and thereupon came a jury, to wit: — (naming the jurors)— who, being elected, tried and sworn, the trUth to speak upon the issues joined, upon their oaths do say, that they do-find for the petitioner upon all the issues joined, to wit: — upon the issues joined upon the fourth, fifth, seventh,, ninth and fourteenth pleas respectively.’ And the defendant, William D. Moseley, not having shewn any objection of cause whatever, against the foreclosure of thé equity of redemption of, in and to the said mortgaged property, in said deeds mentioned, but being in default — and the said petitioner having exhibited to the Court here, the several original promissory, notes, and bills of ex. change, and other evidences of debt, to secure v/hich the mort. gages, in said petitioner’s petition, set forth and filed with the same, were executed; and affidavit having also been made, and read to the Court here, of John G. Gamble, President of the' said Union Bank of Florida, the petitioner for the foreclosure of the said, mortgages, of the amount of principal and-interest claimed, as, due at the time of making such affidavit; and which said promissory notes, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt, it appears to the'Court here, were given by the said Samuel Parkhill, deceased, in his life time; and to secure the payment whereof, the said deeds of mortgage, ■ exhibited to the Court, and filed with such petition, were made', executed and delivered, by said Samuel Parkhill, deceased, in his life time, to the • said petitioner. It is therefore, this fourth day of January, 1845, no cause having been shewn to the contrary, considered by the Court, that the said petitioner do recover of ftie said defendants, Martha Ann Manley, in her own right, Hiram.Manley, in right of his wife, -the said Martha Ann, .and William D. Moseley, administrators de bctnis non of said Samuel Parkhill, deceased, the sum of seventy-one thousand and twenty-three dollars and forty-eight cents, due to the said petitioner, for principal and interest of its mortgage debt aforesaid, up to the rendition of' this decree, together with • its costs and charges of these proceedings by the said petitioner, in this behalf expended, to be taxed by.the Clerk of this Court, to-be.made and levied of the slaves in said mortgages specified and named, and of .the increase of the female slaves, since the execution of the said mort. gage; and if the same shall be insufficient to. satisfy the petitioner’s debt, and the costs and charges aforesaid, then the remainder of said debt to be made and levied of the goods and chattels, lands, slaves and tenements generally, of the said Samuel Parkhill, deceased, in the hands of the said defendants, administrators de bonis non aforesaid, to be administered. And it is further ordered, adjudged , and decreed, that the said defendants, administrators de bonis non aforesaid, and all persons claiming, or tp claim,.by, through-or under the said Samuel Parkhill, deceased, be and.the same are hereby forever foreclosed and barred of a<ndfrom all right and equity of redemption, in and to the said mortgaged property, to wit: — the slaves — (here naming them) — and the increase of the female slaves above named, and every part of said mortgaged,property in said mortgages named, specified and described. And it is further ordered, that this judg-! ment be entered up and filed; and that the petitioner have execution thereon, according to law.”
On the trial of this cause, the following bill of exceptions was filed, which was signed, sealed, and made a part of the record, and which is in these words:
Middle District of Florida,' Leon Superior Court, Fall Term, December 30th, 1844. The Union Bank Florida vs. Hiram Manley administrator in right of his Wife of Sam’l Parkhill, deceased, Martha Ann Manley, administratrix of Sam’l Parkhill, deceased, “ memorandum.” That the counsel for the petitioner on a former day, moved the Court to strike out the pleas filed by the defendants, and appearing upon the records, upon the following grounds, to wit:
1st. Because said pleas are not properly entitled in this, that they are entitled in a cause of Martha Ann Manley, (late Parkhill,) and Hiram Manley, sued as administrator and administratrix of Samuel Parkhill deceased, at the suit of the Union Bank of Florida, upon petition for foreclosure of mortgage and for judgment, &c. Whereas the said pleas upon said petition of the Union Bank of Florida, ought to have been entitled in the cause upon said petition, wherein the Union Bank of Florida, is petitioner against Martha Ann Manley and William D. Moseley, administrators de bonis non of Samuel Parkhill deceased, ■ as the same is now pending in Leon Superior Court.
2nd. And as to the said pleas, firstly, secondly, thirdly and six-leenthly above pleaded. Because the same are not sworn to as di rected by the Statute in such case made and provided. And the same was argued by counsel, but the Court not being fully advised of its decision in this cause, took time to consider thereof, and now in this day the Court being fully advised, ordered the said pleas to be stricken out, to which opinion and decision the defendants by their counsel excepted and prayed, that this their bill of exceptions should be signed and sealed by the Court; which was done.”
There was another bill of exceptions filed in the cause, but it does not embrace any of the points which the Court has found it necessary to decide upon this appeal, and will therefore be no farther noticed. The defendants to wit, Martha Ann Manley and Hiram Manley, her husband, and William D. Moseley, administratrix and administrators de bonis non, prayed an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the (late) Territory of Florida, which was granted. The case was carried up, and was transferred to this Court, pursuant to the provisions contained in the last clause of the 4th section of the 17th article, schedule and ordinance of the constitution of this State, and the 14th section c(f the act to organize (¡his Supreme Court. A motion was m ade on the first day of the Term to dismiss it, upon the same.ground as that on which the motion was made to dismiss thé cáse of Charles D. Stewart vs. Thomas Preston, Junior,, iñ whiph Judge Baltzell, on a former day of this term, delivered, the opinion of the Court,.and. was ■for the same reasons as givén in that case dismissed. Whereupon the appellants by their counsel filed herein the following assignment of errors to wit:
1st. There is error in the petition in praying for, and in the final judgment and decree in-giving one judgment, and one foreclosure on two alledged mortgages. ■ -
2nd.' There is error in giving the judgment and decree in this case* before the, demurrer to first objection filed, 3rd May, 1844, was disposed of. ' ■ • .
3rd. .There is error in the order of the Court of 4th May, 1844, making William D. Moseley a party by suggestion. .
4th. There is no legal notice of such suit given to the administrators de bonis non, and there is no appearance by the administrators de ■ bonis non. ■ '
5th. The Court erred in striking out the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 16th additional objections. - \ '
6th. The Court erred in ordering the other additional objections to be stricken out because not .properly entitled;
7th. The Court erred in sustaining general demurrer to 6th.addi-‘ tional objection. , .
8th.-‘The Court erred in sustaining general demurrer to.10th additional objection. ■ '
9th. The Court erred in sustaining general demurrer to 11th additional objection.
. 10th. The Court erred in sustaining general demurrer to 12th additional objection. • '
11th. The Court erred in sustaining general demurrer to 13th additional objection.
12th. The Court erred in sustaining special demurrer tó 9th additional objection. ;
. 13th. The Court erred in sustaining special demurrer to 15th additional objection..
14th. The Court erred in sustaining special derriurrer to 17th additional objection.
15th. ■ The Court erred in striking out the amended pleas.
16th. The' Court erred in overruling demurrer to replication to 8th additional ¡objection. ' '
17th. The Court erred in the first, s.econd and third instructions to the Jury. ■ '
18th. The Court erred in giving judgment for costs against appellants.
19th. The judgment and decree are at variance with the prayer of the petition. . .
,20th.- Upon the record and pleadings, the-judgment and decree should not have been given in favour of the petitioner.
Passing for; the present, the first error assigned, and (for the reasons before stated,) the second also, we, come*to the third, which is that there is error in the order of the Court of 4th May, 1844, making W. D. Moseley, á party by suggestion. This suit was commenced on the 16th day of February, 1844. W. D. Moseley was hot appointed administrator “tie bonis non,” until the 22nd day of the succeeding month of April.; until that time it does not appear, that he had any connection with the estate of said Samuel Parkhill deceased,' and if this suit was .then pending, or was pending on the 4th day of Mayfollowing, when the suggestion mentioned was made, we>are not aware of any principle of the common law, and certainly we have no statute, by which he could have- been-made a party to it, by a mere suggestion. It is insisted on behalf of the petitioner, that he, together with the said Marth'a Ann Manley, administratrix “ de bonis non,” came into Court, exhibited letters of administration to them “ de bonis non,” upon said estate, and demanded the assets belonging thereto, which it seems were in the hands of a’ receiver, appointed by the Court to take charge of them, and that the fact of his being, such administrator was therefore judicially known to the Court-, and it could for that reason properly grant the order to make him a party defendant by suggestion. ■ No authorities were cited to this point, and it is presumed that none exist., The statement of a single case we thinkmust demonstrate the unsoundnéss of this proposition. Suppose A, against whom twenty'suits aré pending, dies; B obtains’ administration' upon the goods and estate left by him at his death, and sue's C, tor a debt due to his .intestate in his life tim^ makes proferí of his letters of administration, and adduces them on the trial of his cause, which he must do to show his authority to sue. Here the Court may, nay must take judicial notice, that B is administrator of 'the goods and estate which were of A, at the time of his .death. But , could any Court, under such circumstances, make B a party defendant to each of the twenty suits so pending against A, as aforesaid, by a mere suggestion ? We think no lawyer upon mature reflection will answer, this question in the affirmative. Yet updn the principle assumed, a Court might do it, and enter up judgment against him in each case for thousands of dollars. But it is said that he had notice of the order and was therefore a party, and it appears by the record that on the 4th day of November, 1844, a copy of a certified copy of the record of that order, was served on Wm. D. Moseley, administrator “ de bonis non,” of SamueJ Parkhill deceased, by the Marshal. But, if Wm. D. Moseley could have been made a party at all to this proceeding, was that such a notice as .the case'required? There was no order of the Court requiring such a copy to be.served upon him. The copy was not a writ or process known to' the law. It required nothing of, and commanded nothing to be done by. him. It was not verified by the seal of the Court; and was not calculated to enlighten Mr. Moseley much, as to the nature of the proceeding. Upon the whole, we are compelled to say that it was no legal notice to him,-and there is no pretence that'he voluntarily made himself a party; on the contrary, the judgment and decree against him went by default. The third error assigned, is therefore well taken, as are also the fourth, nineteenth and twentieth, so far as they regard Wm. D. Moseley, who is no party to this suit.
The Court dSes'not deem it necessary to enter upon an investigation of all the errors above set .forth, but to examine a few of the most prominent ones, which are deemed to be decisive of the case; in doing which we pass to the 8th and 9th errors assigned, which are, that “ the Court erred in sustaining a general demurrer’ to each of the 10th and 11th, additional ©bjections.” The 10th objection, and also the 11th is in substance and effect a plea of former judgment, recovered upon the same identical causes of action set up in this case. The plea commences, “ and said defendants for further plea in this behalf by leave of the Court,” &c.; averring and protesting, that’since the institution of this suit, their letters of administration were revoked and annulled by competent authority, and that all of the estate of Samuel Parkhill deceased, in their hands unadministered, was taken away by like authority, to wit: — The order of Leon Superior Court, and at the instance of petitioner, showing objections and cause by - • way of plea in conformity to the statute in such case made and provided, against a judgment and foreclosure of the equity of redemption in the said mortgaged property, in plaintiff’s petition mentioned under the statute -in comformity with complainants petition, and answering said petition, , and showing equity against the same, by Brock-enbrough & Archer, their attorneys, come and defend the wrong and injury, when, &c., and say that said petitioner ought not to have the judgment and foreclosure by-, its .petition sought, because they say, &c., (setting out fully and distinctly the several matters, 'which are set up as causes of action in this case from one to eleven inclusive,) and they s.ay that said plaintiff heretofore to wit, in the adjourned -Fall Term of-1842, continued and held -into the year. 1843, in the Superior Court of Leon County, held at Tallahassee, in the-County of Leon, before Samuel J. Douglas, Judge; impleaded the defendant Martha Ann, then & feme, sole, arid widow, in certain pleas of trespass on the case, upon promises, to the damage of said petitioner of divers amounts and sums of money,in the said several cases specified, for the non payment and non performance of divers promises to pay the very same identical promissory notes, and the several sums- of money and interest therein specified, in this plea herein before mentioned, and set forth in petitioner’s petition, and mprtgage aforesaid', and such proceedings .were thereupon had in that Court upon the said pleas, that afterwards to wit, on the 24th day of February, 1843, at the County aforesaid, the said petitioner, then plaintiff, by the consideration and judgment ofthe Said Court recovered, &c., (setting out the recovery in due.form distinctly upon eachi and every *one of the several causes of action mentioned,) and there aver that the said Martha Ann Parkhill, in the said several pleas mentioned, is the same Martha Ann Manley and none ‘ other, she having since -said .judgments were pbtained as aforesaid against her, intermarried with Hiram Manley, as in said petition alleged ;■ and the'fce defendants further aver, that the several causes- of. action on which the said judgments were obtained in the said pleas, are the samp and all of the same and none other than the several notes, bills and liabilities in plaintiffs petition, and supposed mortgages mentioned as by the records and proceedings thereof, still remaining in the said Superior Court of Leon County at Tallahassee in León County aforesaid, more fully and at large appears, which said judgments still remain in full force and effect, not in the least-reversed, satisfied or made void, and this the said defendants are ready to verity by the said records. Wherefore they pray judgment if the said petitioner ought to have and maintain its aforesaid action thereof against them.
The eleventh objection is very similar in its leading features to the tenth, except in the concluding partafter the usual averments of identity of the defendant and of the causes of action, dzc., it proceeds as follows to wit: “And the said petitionér, The Union Bank .of Florida, plaintiff in the several actions wherein the judgments were recovered against the defendant Martha Ann, as administratrix as aforesaid (dum sola,) in each of the said several actions in the last plea mentioned, admitted of record, in and by the said several judgments, that the said defendant Martha Ann, had no assets of the said Samuel deceased,, in her hands imadministered, sufficient whereby to .satisfy the said damages of the said Union Bank, so in each of said actions recovered as aforesaid, or any part of them or either of them, and then and there at the time and place of the rendition of the said judgments the said Union Bank, petitioner, being then plaintiff, took judgment in each of said several actions agairist the said defendant Martha Ann, then a feme sole, to take effect as to assets “ Quando acciderint,” and this, they the said defendants are ready to verify by the said several records of judgments remaining in said Leon Superior Court, in this and last pleas before mentioned. • Wherefore they pray judgment if the said petitioner ought to b.e admitted or received^ to file his said petition, wherein he prays judgment generally of the said mortgage debt aforesaid; without saying that any assets or effects, wherewith and whereby to satisfy said judgments, have come to the hands of these defendants or either of-them, since the rendition of the said several judgments, quando, &c., above pleaded.” A general demurrer was put in by the petitioner to each of these pleas or objections, which after argument were sustained by the Court. Was there error in this ? If either of those pleas contained a good and substaintial defence to this suit, the Court erred in sustaining the demurrer thereto. Did they or either of them cpntain such defence ?
It may not be improper here to remark, that a misapprehension, (to some extent,) seems to have prevailed in relation to the proceedings under this statute; for the foreclosure of the equity of redemption in mortgage, viz : that the defendant in stating his objections, should be required to comply with the strictest rules of technical special pleading, while the petitioner may be indulged in a more latitudinous course of proceeding. But the converse of this proposition would be a more reasonable rule.
A statute which gives a new remedy by summary proceedings, or other deviations from our ancient constitutions, ought not to receive a liberal construction. Poal vs. Neal, 2d Sid. page 63. Dwarris on statutes 77. This is such a statute — all of its provisions are for the benefit of mortgagees. Nothing is conceded to him who holds the equity of redemption. In other cases at law the mere entry of an attorney’s name to the suit, entitled the defendant to a continuance at the first term, and he may plead most of his defences without oath, and has seventy days after the close of the appearance term, within which to file his pleas. But when the mortgagee proceeds under this statute to foreclose the equity of redemption, the defendant must file his objections fifteen days before the first day of the term next following the expiration of the notice. They are required by this act to be sworn to, and the case must be tried at the first term if the plaintiff shall require it, unless good cause be shown by the opposite party for a continuance, and even the important right of trial by jury is by a literal construction of the act, also left to the option of the petitioner. This statute is in derogation of the common law, an innovation upon old and well established principles, and mortgagees when they resort to it, may well be held to a strict compliance with its provisions; but the defendant in making his objections, should not be required to conform to all “ the nice sharp quillets” of special pleading. If he sets them out substantially, so that the petitioner can readily see and understand the grounds of his objection, or in other words if he sets-them out as specifically as he would be obliged to do, the matter of his defence in an answer in Chancery, or in a notice of special maU, ter under the general issue in a suit at law, verified by oath agreeable to the requirement of the statute relating to the subject, it is sufficient.
Having premised thus much, we proceed to consider the effect of these pleas upon this cause, and for the purpose of this inquiry, the facts alledged in them are to be taken as true. The petitioner, then, has already obtained judgments at law upon these several causes of action. Are they entitled to another judgment at law ? The object of the statute is two-fold. First: A foreclosure of the equity of redemption; — and second, a judgment for the debt secured by the mortgage. The 8th section of the act declares, that “ the judgment of the Court in the foreclosure of a mortgage, shall, in all cases, be entered up and filed, and that execution shall issue thereon, as in other cases.” Duval’s'Comp. 41 — 42. . It was urged, in support of this proceeding, that a'mortgagée has, at common law, three remedies, all of which he may-pursue at the same time, viz: — that he may bring suit at law, upon the bond or note .'secured by the mortgage ; institute an action of ejectment, to put himself in possession of the rents and profits of the estate, and file a bill in Chancery, to foreclose the mortgage. All this is Very true. ""But in the action of ejectment,- the mortgagee would accomplish nothing more than to put himself in possession of the rents and profits. And in Equity he would obtain nothing but his foreclosure. In the case of Dunkley against Van Burén"" and others, 3 John. Chy. Reps. 330 — 331—the Chancellor held, that “ the party on a bill to foreclose a mortgage is confined in his remedy to the pledge. Such a suit is not intended to act in personam. It seems to be generally admitted in the books, that the mortgagee may proceed at law on his covenant, at the same' time that he is prosecuting on his mortgage in Chancery; and that, after foreclosure here, may sue at lawon.his bond for the deficiency. Lord Redesdale, in 1 Schoale & Lefroy, 166. 13 Vez. 205. Aylet vs. Hill, Dicken 551. 2 Bro. Ch. R. 125. Perry vs. Barker, 13 Vez. 198. Dashwood vs. Blythway, 1 Eq. Cases Abr. 317.
The natural, and certainly the most convenient and beneficial course for the mortgagor, (says Mr. Justice Story, in his 2 Comm, on Eq. 293,) would seem to be, to follow-out the civil law rules on this subject; that is to say, primarily and-ordinarily to direct a sale of the mortgaged property, giving the debtor any surplus, after discharging the mortgage debt. And secondarily: to apply the remedy of foreclosure only to special cases, where the former remedy would not apply, 'Or might be inadequate or injurious to the interests of the parties. This course has, accordingly, been adopted in many of the American Courts of Equity, and is also the prevailing practice in Ireland. And this is done without any distinction,- whether there be a power to sell given in the mortgage or not. 4 Kent’s Comm. Lect. 58, p. 181—182—2d. edition. Brinkerhoff vs. Thallheiner, 2 John. Chy.

In England a practice widely different has prevailed. A bill for a foreclosure is deemed, in common cases, the exclusive and appropriate remedy; and the Courts of Equity there refuse, except in special cases, to decree a compulsory sale, against the will of the mortgagor. These Courts, however, have departed from this general rule in certain cases; as, where the estate is deficient to pay the in-cumbrance ; or where the mortgagor is dead, and there .is a deficiency of personal assets; or the mortgage is of a dry reversion; or where the mortgagor dies, and the estate descends to an infant. 2 Story’s Eq. 294.
Our statute is cumulative. It provides a fourth remedy, and was intended to save the mortgagee the necessity of both a suit at law, and a suit in Chancery, to obtain his mortgage debt. But when the mortgagee has elected to proceed at law, and has obtained a judgment there upon his debt, he cannot then proceed under this statute, and obtain another judgment at law. The law abhors a multiplicity of actions, and where one remedy has been resorted to with success, it usually restrains resort to another, to accomplish the same purpose. Lessee of Allen vs. O’Parish, 1 Ohio Cond. Rep. 536. Here the effort is to obtain a second judgment at law for the same debt, and that too, without alledging that assets have come to the hands of the defendants, since the rendition of the first judgment, notwithstanding that judgment was taken “ guando acciderint,” by which the plaintiff admitted that the defendant had fully administered to that time. 2 Saunders, 219, note, (2,) Parker vs. Dee. 3 Swanst. 532. Note to Drewry vs. Thacker. And accordingly, the terms of such judgment are, that the plaintiff do recover his debt, to be levied of the goods of the testator, which shall thereafter come to the hands of the executor, (or administrator, as the case maybe.) 2. Saunders, 210, note, (2.) And in debt, on scire facias on this judgment, proof of the executor, (or administrator,) receiving assets, is always confined at the trial, to a period subsequent to the judgment. Taylor vs. Hallman, Buller’s N. P. 169. 2 Saunders, 219—a—note, (2.) 2 Williams, on Executors, 1221. 1
When a. judgment is obtained, the original cause of action is merged in it; and if the plaintiff proceeds afterwards, he should proceed on his judgment. The appellee in this case, having obtained a judgment at law, before the commencement of this suit, upon all the causes of action set forth in this petition, should, when it pro. ¡ceeded to foreclose-these mortgages, have proceeded in Chancery upon that judgment, and not again at law, upon these original causes of action.. That course would have obviated all the difficulty resulting from this judgment, “ guando acciderint.” But it will be perceived that, if this suit could be sustained, the defendants must either be permitted to avail themselves of that judgment by plea, (as was attempted in this case,) or they would again be driven to their plea of plene adminislravit; and if the latter course were adopted, the jury must necessarily have extended their inquiry back to the date of the letters of administration ; and their verdict in relation to assets, would, of course, have covered the whole period which had elapsed between that date, and the rendition of the judgment, and the trial of the cause in the Court below, which may have worked irreparable injury and injustice, not only to defendants, but to their sureties. Pleading the judgment, therefore, (or setting it up as an objection,) seems to have been their only safe and proper course. But it is contended by the counsel of the appellee, that these pleas are bad, because they are pleaded in bar, and not in abatement. Bút a former recovery is a good plea in bar. 1 Chitty’s PI. 475, old ed.; 7 Amer. from 6 Lond. ed. 513 ; and authorities there cited in note, (c.)
The objection, therefore, if it were a valid one in such a case as this, could only extend to the matter of foreclosure ; and furnishes another reason, and a very cogent one, why this mixed proceeding, (for we cannot separate them,) should not be permitted, after a judgment at law, upon the same causes of action. But we do not consider the ordinary rules of special pleading, or the technical rules of practice in ordinary cases at law, applicable to a proceeding under our staLute of foreclosure. The proceeding is an anomalous one, for which neither the Courts of Common Law, or Equity, furnish a precedent; and so the appellee has treated it; for its petition neither contains the essential requisites of a declaration at law, or of a bill in Chancery. It contains something of both; but not enough of either, to stand the test of scrutiny, by the rules of pleading which prevail in either of those tribunals; and were we to apply that strictness'to it, which is demanded in relation to the pleas or objections, the appellee must fail on that ground alone, if on no other. But we are not inclined to apply a greater degree of strictness to either, than is necessary to subserve the principles of justice and equity. Indeed, a more liberal spirit than prevailed in times gone by, in regard to special pleading, one more consonant to the spirit of the age, seems every where to be gaining ground ; and we feel warranted in departing from those strict technical and rigid rules, which were formerly applied to this science, whenever such departure may facilitate the attainment of justice, without endangering any of its principles; and pur Legislature has left us an open door for so doing.
But the eleventh objection is rather in the nature of a' plea in abatement than in bar. It is, however, again insisted, that if this is in abatement, it was filed tod late, having been put in after a plea in bar. But if the first plea filed in thé case, is to be considered as out of the record, for the causes above mentioned, then this plea was amongst the first that were filed in the case; and if - the first plea is to be considered as part of the record, for -,the purpose of this objection, then' it must be so for all'other purposes. To that plea the petitioner demurred, arid the issue of law thereby made, remains undis-posed of. This is the second errof-assigned, and we passed^ over it for the reasons before- stated. Indeed, it may have been difficult to have gotten over it in any other way, unless, as contended by the counsel for the appellee, that not being sworn to, it is no objection under the statute, is such an absolute nullity, that the defect cannot be waived, and the Court may disregard it.
Without stopping to inquire whether these propositions are correct-or not; or to examine th.e authorities, (a number of which were cited to sustain them,) let them for the present purpose, be so considered ; and then this'first plea is, (as wé have before been disposed to regard it,) out of the record, and does not stand in the way of the plea under consideration;' But if the first plea filed had been sworn to, and the issue upon it disposed of, still another difficulty lies' in the way of the objection we are now considering. The petitioner, instead of taking the ordinary step to rid itself of the tenth and eleventh pleas, demurred to them. It is too late,- therefore, to object that they were not filed in time. By the demurrers, the facts alledged in the pleas are admitted to be true, and issues of law were made for the Court to détermine. Upon these issues the Court, after argument had thereon, gave judgment for the petitioner. In doing this we think it erred. These pleas, (and especially the last,) were a sufficientobjection to this proceeding.
The 16th-error assigned, viz: “The Court erred■ in overruling the demurrer to the replication to the eighth additional objection,” presents some very important questions; but as most, (if not all of them,) have 'been considered and decided in another case, akin to this, at the present term; we forbear any remark upon the subject here.
The first error assigned, so far as it relates to the judgment or decree, is well taken. The decree should have directed a sale of the negro slaves mentioned in the first mortgage, together with the issue and increase of the female slaves, the proceeds thereof to be applied upon the payment of the debt thereby secured; and the residue or surplus, (if any,) to be applied to the second mortgage. But this error, as well as several other minor ones, which we have not deemed it necessary to discuss, might be very easily corrected, were it not for those of more importance, which we have maturely considered, and find insurmountable. •
The judgment must be reversed, with costs, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court of Leon county, with directions to dismiss the petition.

"John Miller and Bryan Croom, vs. Frederick Hoc, Survivor",1 Fla. 189,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Hawkins, Justice:
The record in this case certainly presents a series of anomalies, and the questions for the consideration of the Court are embraced in the enquiries, how far consent of parties can remedy error; what defects in pleading are cured by vei-dict, and whether the verdict and judgment of the Court below have been rendered in compliance with the well settled rules of law. Although a Court of error will go far to sustain a judgment of a Court which tried the cause, when upon a view of the whole case it comes to the conclusion that [substantial justice has been done between the parties ; yet still, there are certain fundamental rules governing legal proceedings, which cannot be departed from, without producing great confusion and evil results. There can be no doubt but that the Court below erred, as alleged in the assignment of errors, in pronouncing a judgment by default, whilst the record shows that pleas were in and filed by the defendant.
The record states that no plea was filed by defendant, upon which the judgment by default was entered. As a general rule, the record is to be taken as true, and nothing is be averred against the allegations contained in it, but we must examine the whole record; and it would be carrying the above axioms to an absurd extent, if after its inspection, we should say, ■ the judgment by default was correctly rendered, because the record said there were no pleas filed, when in fact two pleas stand in bold relief, and undisposed of. It would seem far more consonant with reason to conclude, that they were overlooked, and the judgment pronounced through inadvertance, than to take for granted, even a record averment so utterly at variance with the strongest evidence of our perceptions.
There is nothing in the record to show, that a motion was made by the defendant in the Court below, to set aside the judgment by default thus irregularly granted, as might have been done; nor does it appear that the plaintiffs availed themselves of any legal rights growing out of it; so that it is to be inferred from the further proceeding of the cause, that this judgment was waived by both parties, perhaps considered as struck out and a nullity — by the defendants, by not moving as above — by the plaintiffs,, by pleading in disregard of it. Without moving to have the judgment set aside, the latter reply to the plea of non damnificatus filed by defendants and demur to that of nil dehit. The defendants do not rejoin to the replication, nor join in the demurrer; but “ by consent of parties it is agreed that the two cases shall be submitted to the samé jury.” The cases referred to are the one at bar and another between the same parties, as shown by the record.
The consent alluded to, seems nót to have extended further than that the same jury were to bring in separate verdicts in each case, and not as contended for by counsel, that the cases should be consolidated, and one verdict be rendered for the two cases.
The Court can only be guided by the record as to the version to be given to this submission, and as there is nothing contained in it that conveys the idea of consolidation, we must take the words as we .find them. If the consent went to the extent contended by the counsel for appellee, a different decision as to the verdict first rendered, might be arrived at, as, consents may take away error ; and guided by this rule, the court is constrained to overlook the irregularity of the judgment by default.
With the views of the submission, as above expressed, the Court is of opinion, that separate and independent verdicts should have been rendered in each case. Here the Court might rest and remand the case to the Court below for correction of its proceedings, but it may not be inappropriate to diseuss some other points raised •in the cause.
It is contended by the appellee that the record shows that there were issues before the jury and issues joined ; but we ■ can discern nothing showing such to be the (act, further than that after the submission of the case, certain persons were elected, tried and sworn to speak the truth upon the issues joined.
The pleadings certainly exhibit no issue either of fact or of law. “ As the object of all pleading or judicial allegation (says Mr. Stephens,) is to ascertain the subject for decision, &c. the main object of that system of pleading established in the Common Law of England, is to ascertain it by the production of an issue.”
The counsel for appellee insists that by the statute of jeofails of our State, the error, if any existed, is cured by the verdict; but that does not apply where there has been no issue or non-joinder. An immaterial issue is not aided at Common Law, or by statute. (Buller’s Ni. Pr. 321 — 2d Saunders, 319. In such cases Courts will grant a repleader) — and Green J. in the case of Truss vs. Old, 6 Ran. 560, remarks, “ that the statute of jeofails gives the effect of curing errors, only where a verdict is given without exception.”
Although the record states the jury were sworn to try the issues joined, that cannot remove the irregularity of the verdief, or prove that issues really existed.
In Sydner against Burke and wife, 4 Ran. 161, we see that th^ act of jeofails will not sustain a verdict and judgment in a case in which the record states that the jury were sworn to try the issue joined, but does not show that any plea was filed by defendant, upon which issue could have been joined.
The case of Stevens vs. Thornton’s adm’rs. .1 Wash. R. 156, is in point. In that case there was an entry upon the record after the replication, concluding with a verification, to which there was no rejoinder, that “ issue was thereupon joined between the parties.” The entry was deemed not sufficient, because in fact, there appeared no issue.
With these views, and there having been no issue properly made, up for submission to the jury, we think the error well assigned by appellant.
It appears that there were motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, and these remained, so far as appears by the record, undisposed of. A presumption may arise, that these motions were refused, but it will not be necessary to advert further to the assignment of errors in relation to them, inasmuch as the first verdict has been declared irregular. And so in- relation to the second verdict, for there appears to have been two verdicts in one cause, the Court feels no hesitation in declaring that it should be set aside. It seems that after the rendition of the first verdict, pn Saturday, and their discharge, the jury were recalled by the Court on the ensuing Wednesday, for the purpose of apportioning the damages by them re« turned in their verdict. After their discharge, the Court below erred in again assembling them to put their verdict in form, as this should have been done before their discharge, and a venire de novo should have been the proper order. — After a jury have returned their verdict, have been discharged and separated, they cannot be recalled to alter or amend it. Sergeant against the State, 11 Ohio R. 472.
The cases cited by appellee do not refer to cases where the jury had been discharged. The strongest one, that of Winslow against Draper, 8 Pick. 170, was this. . The jury had retired to consult on their verdict on Saturday afternoon, and had permission from the Court to. separate as soon as they had made up their verdict. On the following Monday morning, they rendered in an imperfect verdict, which the Court made them correct, as they found a substantial verdict on the merits, and it was then put in proper form.
' It would be superfluous to dilate upon the instructions as prayed for by the defendants, in the Court below, though it is very clear that the Court should have instructed the jury, that they were not to assess the damages in each case pro rata, according to amount, but as to the evidence in each case independent of the other.
As contended for by the appellee, the Court is not to be understood as dissenting from the doctrine, that a Court will not examine the propriety of amendments of the Court below, when these amendments are within the power of the Court, given it either by Common Law or statute, amendments generally being matter of discretion for the Court. In this case, the error seems to have been the not making suitable amendments. But the Court of errors should certainly have all the proceedings of the subordinate Court before it, so that from a view of the pleadings, the process, continuances. the finding of a jury upon a proper issue and the judgment — (for without them a Court would be groping in the dark and find great difficulty) — they might come to a decision.
With these views, we think the judgment of the Court below must be reversed; which is accordingly ordered, and that this cause be remanded to Leon Circuit Court for further proceedings to be had therein, in accordance with the views contained in this opinion."
"John Miller and Bryan Croom, Appellants, vs. Frederick Hoc, Survivor, &c.",1 Fla. 197,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Hawkins, Justice;
This case must be governed by the decision of the Court in the preceding case, as the same points are involved in it; the pleadings seem substantially the same, and the record shows the same errors committed in this case as in the one, just decided.
It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the judgment be reversed, and that this cause be remanded to the Court below for further proceedings, in accordance with the views contained in the opinion in the other case between the same parties."
"Eli Horn and Jeremiah Savell, Executors of Joab Horn, vs. David Gartman",1 Fla. 197,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Macrae, Justice;
This is a petition for a re-hearing of this cause, which has beets filed since the last term of this Court, and the question arises whether this application can be entertained in view of the 24th Rule' of this Court, which provides that “ re-hearings must be applied for by petition in writing within fifteen days after the judgment or decree/7 and that “ the Court will consider the petition without argument,’7 &c. This rule is analagous to that which regulates motions for new trials which requires that every such motion shall be made within the Term at which the cause has been tried, in which such motion is proposed to be made. In the opinion of this Court, the 24th Rule clearly contemplates the filing of a petition for a re-hearing before the expiration of the term at which the decision of the case is had. This is the general rule in all cases of motions to be made before a Court in reference to a case depending before it.— After the term, as a general rule, the Court cannot exercise power or control over a Cause which has been determined, further than to perfect and carry out its judgment by orders correcting errors apparent in the proceedings, or similar errors.
It is therefore considered .and ordered that this case be stricken from the docket»"
Theophilus Beatty vs. Thomas Ross,1 Fla. 198,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baltzeu., Justice :
The defendant in the Court below applied for' permission to take his' Cfise to the Circuit Court of the United States, .having presented a petition and affidavit stating, that he was then, and at the time of issuing the writ, an alien, and that the' matter in dispute' exceeds in value five hundred dollars, exclusive of costs. There had been prior to this, a judgment by default for want of a plea required to be filed days before the second term, and the defendant at the first term had entered his appearance to the' action. Under such circumstances, it is quite clear that he was not entitled to his motion under the act of Congress of 1Í89, allowing to aliens the privilege of removing cases instituted against them in the State Courts to' the Courts of the United States.
The main reliance of defendant here, is placed upon' the assumption, that the suit was instituted in the Superior Court of the late Territory, which was established by Congress, and at the change of government it belonged to the District court of the United States as its rightful successor. If this be true, it should not have been on the docket of the State Court, and defendant was entitled to'his motion. The first question for our consideration is, has the Court of the United States, organized for this State, the right to the papers of the late Superior Courts, and to try suits commenced and pending before them.
We have felt that the subject should be approached with a due sense of its importance to the individual whose rights are at stake as well as a proper regard to the rights of a co-ordinate branch of the government, not forgetting what is due to our own position as officers of a State of the Union.
This Court and the Circuit Courts of the State, have-alike, with-oüt hesitancy, ordered the transfer of all cases where the courts of the United States have exclusive jurisdiction. - But the difficulty lies with cases where it is. concurrent, where each court has the right to try and adjudicate the matter in controversy. The Judges of the Superior courts of the Territory under that clause of the State constitution continuing “ all officers until superceded under the constitution,” took possession of the records and papers after our admission, and exercised jurisdiction over suits pending and instituted in those courts. This they did as State Judges for several months after our admission, and in the very case under consideration. They administered the local laws of the State, deciding suits between citizen and citizen, and trying indictments for assaults and offences of like character. The State Judges succeeded them in the different counties, and thus became possessed of the records and suits. Being so possessed, it was in the opinion of the court, not only competent for them to adjudicate the cases presented for trial, but it was their bounden duty to do so. It1 was clearly not a matter of option with the judge to transfer the case to another tribunal, but it was the right of the party to have hi's case tried, and the court could not properly refuse it.
. A reference to the well established rules of law in cases of concurrent jurisdiction, will show, we think, that we are not mistaken in these views. “In all cases of concurrent jurisdiction, the court which first has possession of the subject must decide it.” Smith vs. McIvor, 9 Wh. 532. But ther£ is another fact not to be overlooked in the consideration of this question; the District Court of the .United States has only been organized during the present month, so that the State Courts, if inclined to transfer, must have waited nearly two years before the removal, whilst the party would have been subjected to unusual delay without a satisfactory excuse for it. And now, that a court is organized, we do not perceive that the difficulty is either lessened or removed. There te no provision in the act of Congress for the transfer of cases to it-from the Superior Courts, and without such provision the jurisdiction'does not attach. The courts of the United States take by express grant, and “ can exercise jurisdiction in those cases only, where it is. conferred upon them by act of Congress.” 1 Wash. C. C. R. 231. 1 Brockenbrough, 203.
Situated then as these cases now are, the courts of the State alone have the exclusive right to try and decide them, and there is no other having a right even concurrent with them. If the defendant had been driven to his plea, as was his only course after his motion was overruled, what could he have asserted, how defended himself against the rule well established, that “ in a plea to the jurisdiction, the defendant must show that another court has exclusive jurisdiction over the cause of action ?” Archbold PI. and Ev. 280. 6 East, 583.
Whilst free from doubt as to these ""views, we are not content to rest our decision upon the prior organization of the State Courts, or the fact of. possession merely, satisfied that the right of the State Courts is equal, and by no means subordinate to that of the Federal Courts. We attribute no importance to the fact that Congress established the Superior Courts. This did not make them United States Courts. Such an idea was long since rejected by the Supreme court of the United States, who decided that they were “ not constitutional courts in which the judicial power conferred by the constitution on the general government can be deposited — they are incapable of receiving it. The jurisdiction with which they are invested is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article of the constitution, but is conferred by Congress in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the Territories of the United States. In legislating for them, Congress exercises the combined powers of the general and of a State government.”— Am. Insurance vs. Canter. 1 Peters, 546.
It will not, we apprehend, be seriously contended, that action by the General Government as a State, or whilst in the exercise of State powers, can rightly form the basis of a claim against the State, or that the General Government derived higher or larger jurisdiction or powers from such possession. According to the theory of all our institutions, governments are but trustees for the people, and we hold this to be the true position which the General Government occupied during the existence of. the Territory, trustees for the people until they became competent to take the blessings of self government upon themselves. On our admission into the Union the trust expired, and each party was remitted to the position which, according to the structure of the State and Federal governments, each should respectively occupy, neither superior, nor having greater claims, except over particular subjects where exclusive right or jurisdiction may prevail — both equal in cases of concurrent jurisdiction.
This declaration of the Supreme Court as to the character of the Superior Courts, is fatal to the succession which is claimed for the District Court of the United States. Independently of this, it is not perceived how a court of limited jurisdiction as this latter is, “ taking only by grant,” having cognizance, not of cases generally, but only a few specially circumstanced, amounting to a small' portion of the cases which an unlimited jurisdiction would embrace, and in reference to whose action the fair presumption is not as with regard to a court of general jurisdiction that “ a cause is within its jurisdiction, unless the contrary'’appears, and which renders it necessary to set forth upon the record, the facts and circumstances which give jurisdiction.” 1 Cond. Rep. 205, it is not perceived how such a court can be the successor of a court, not only of general jurisdiction, but of powers beyond those possessed by any other court in the Union, either State or Federal, indeed combining the powers of both courts. If “ succession in á body politic be as defined, an inheritance in a body private,” the District Court would seem to be rather the devisee than the heir of the. inheritance. This latter appellation and that of successor would seem to belong rather to the State Courts, being courts of general jurisdiction, and going to the different counties as the Superior courts did, dispensing justice as they did, and succeeding to most, if not all of their cases — “ a successor being defined to be he that followeth or cometb in another’s place.” 6 Jacob Law Diet. 134.
It is further insisted that the act of the State Legislature makes provision, that “causes pending in the Superior Courts shall be transferred to the Circuit Courts of the proper county, except eases cognizable by the Federal Courts, which may be organized in this State, which cases shall be transferred to said courts; and all writs issued by said Superior Courts shall be returned to said Circuit courts, to be tried and decided therein and thereby.” The statute is rather ambiguous — the design of the Legislature was probably directed to cases of exclusive jurisdiction, without noticing the distinction between them and such as are concurrent. The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, by the constitution of the State, embraces “ all matters, civil and criminal, within the State, not otherwise excepted in the constitutionand it may well be doubted whether the Legislature can impair or deprive them of it. We are, however, clearly of opinion that the fourth clause of the schedule and ordinance of the same instrument, is so full and explicit as to leave little or no room for legislation on the subject. That declares that “all actions at law, or suits in chancery, or any proceeding pending, or which may be pending in any court of the Territory of Florida, may be commenced or transferred to such court of the State as may have jurisdiction of the subject matter thereof.”— Page 24, State constitution.
We are not insensible of the fact that different sentiments have been announced by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Palao vs. Hunt, decided at its last term, 1846. Whilst we would defer, with great pleasure, on all proper occasions to the great learning and general accuracy of that exalted tribunal, we are constrained for the reasons stated above, to express our dissent to their opinion in this case, not including the decision on the - point presented, the accuracy of which we pretend not to question. This contrariety has made it necessary to extend- our own views further 'than has been our desire or the case itself would warrant. The importance of a correct understanding of the true relations between the two governments, so connected as it is with the harmony which ought to prevail between them, and especially the judicial departments, has also induced a more extended discussion of the subject.
The Chief Justice decided this case in the court below, and his decision being sustained by the unanimous opinion of the court, the judgment of the court below is confirmed."
Theophilus Beatty vs. Grant Scurry,1 Fla. 210,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baltzell, Justice:
The same questions arise and are presented in this cause as have -been decided to-day in the case from the same court, between Beat-iy and Ross, and for reasons there stated, the judgment is affirmed."
"Bryan Croom vs. Joseph Swann, administrator of John Shaw",1 Fla. 211,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Hawkins, Justice:
This was an action of assumpsit brought to recover the amount of a judgment recovered against Swann by John Shaw, in an action of false warranty on a horse sold by John Oliver, in his life time to Shaw, said horse having been sold by Oliver as the agent of Croom, the appellant.
It would appear by the record that Croom authorised Oliver to sell the horse, but there is no testimony to show that he authorised Oliver to warrant him as to soundness. The price of the horse was one hundred and fifty dollars, and Robert L. Harrison, one of the witnesses, testifies that he heard Croom say, that he had received full compensation from Oliver, for the proceeds of sale of the horse, though he does not recollect that Croom stated the amount.
Shaw, it would seem by the testimony, was aware that Oliver sold the horse only as agent of Croom — that Shaw kept the horse for a time, and then sold him to Penny, who sold him to another person.
Shaw subsequently instituted suit against Swann, the administrator of Oliver, the present plaintiff, declaring in assumpsit on a warranty of the soundness of the horse, and obtained á judgment and a verdict for $152 10 damages, and his costs. The suit from which the present appeal is taken, was brought to recover said damages and costs, and on the trial in Leon Superior court, the record of the judgment &c. of the original suit of Shaw vs. Swann, adm’r. was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, the appellee — objected to by Croom, and the objection overruled by the court. The defendant (Croom) in the court below, offered no evidence, but moved the Court to instruct the jury that said record was not' sufficient or legal evidence of any authority by Croom to Oliver to make the warranty; that the record of the recovery aforesaid, without parol evidence of said warranty, and of such authority to warrant was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover. •
That there was not evidence for the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff. The court below instructed the jury that the record was not inter alios, and was legal and competent evidence in the suit.
2d. That the record, together with the parol evidence of the receipt of the purchase money, and the letters of administration, were sufficient to enable plaintiff to recover, and that it was not necessary to entitle the plaintiff to recover, to. prove .by evidence',aliunde the said record, that the defendant authorised Oliver to warrant the horse to Shaw, or. that Oliver did warrant him.
To these instructions, the defendant excepted, and a bill of exceptions framed thereupon. Verdict for the plaintiff Swann, and judgment, from which appeal was taken to this Court.
The propriety of the decision of the court below, rests mainly on the question whether the record of the judgment recovered by Shaw against Swann, the appellee, was properly admitted in evidence against Croom, the appellant.
As contended for by the appellee, the record indubitably proves the amount which the administrator of Oliver had paid to Shaw; but . this is not enough to justify a judgment against Croom. If Croom had been a party or privy to the record or suit pending between Shaw and Swann, then it would have been available to the extent of the facts contained in it; but there was no privity. The suit was brought by Shaw against Swann, who declined to shield himself by the agency of his intestate, as he could and should have done, had Oliver acted in compliance with the orders or instructions of Croom.
Oliver in this case seems to have acted as the special agent of Croom, and not as a general agent. He had, as would appear by the evidence, a power to sell, but there is nothing to show that he had authority to warrant.
Mr. Chitty says, “ the general rule is, that a person who has contracted in the capacity of an agent, and that fact is known at the time to the person with whom he contracts, such agent is not liable ■to an action for the non-performance of the contract, even for a deceitful warranty.” 1 Chitty on PI. 38, 7 Am. Ed,
And- where a person undertakes to do an act as the agent of another, if he does not possess authority from the principal therefor, or if he exceeds the authority delegated to him, he will be responsible therefor to the person with whom he is dealing, for or on account of his principal.- Story on Agency, 264.
It is contended for by the appellee, that though there may be no evidence, that Croom authorised Oliver to warrant the horse as to soundness, yet that Croom’s acceptance of the proceeds of the sale of the horse, and his remark “ that he was the proper person to lose itthat is, the price of the horse, amounted to an adoption of the act of his agent, even if he exceeded his authority, and acted without or against the orders of Croom.
There is no' doubt, that .an express ratification is not necessary to charge the principal, and a subsequent assent may be inferred from circumstances, which the law considers equal to express ratification. Livermore on Agency, 44. 2 Mass. 186. So where a principal enjoys the fruits and benefits of the act of his agent, he shall not be allowed to say afterwards the act was- illegal. 3 Mis. 496. Bell es. Cunningham, 3 Peters’ 81.
But there is no evidence to show that Croom was aware, that his agent had made any warranty as to the soundness of the horse when he .accepted the proceeds of the sale, and in the absence of this testimony, Ms receipt of the money only extends to a ratification of the sale of the horse, whilst the remark before set forth would seem only to convey the idea of an admission of moral obligation in ignorance of his legal rights, and upon which no action could rest, unless there had been a previous legal liability.
' But admitting the argument of the counsel for appellee, that Croom had rendered himself liable by the assumption or ratification of the act of his agent, to whom is he responsible ? Clearly to Shaw, and not to his agent, unless that agent could show, that a deception had been practiced upon him by his principal; and that in pursuance of orders or instructions, he bona fide makes false representations as to the goods of his principal, and is compelled to pay damages to a purchaser on account thereof. Story on Agency, 339. In such a case Croom would have been directly amenable to Swann, but no such case is shown'. \ ' '
If Shaw had acquired a right of action’ against Croom, the latter had the privilege of asserting and’ maintaining his legal rights in an action against himself, but not through his agent; and he is not to be reached in this indirect, circuitous and sinuous manner. “ No one in general,” say, Mr. Starkie, “can be bound by a verdict or judgment, unless he be a party to the suit, or be in privity with the party, or posses the power of making himself a party.” He has no power of cross examining witnesses, of adducing evidence in furtherance of his rights, &c. 1 Starkie on Ev. 191.
No one can be affected, still less concluded by any sentence, decree or judgment in any suit or legal proceeding, to which he was not actually or in consideration of law, a privy. Ib. 181, 1300 ; and besides, he loses the benefit of appeal.
The reason of these rules are founded in justice and morality; for besides these, reflection must at once suggest the extreme danger at all times of fraud and collusion between the agent and purchaser.— Every consideration of propriety, public policy and sheer justice, forbid the idea, that Croom is to be estopped by the record introduced in the court below, and denied the privilege of making de-fence of his legal rights.
If otherwise, the grossest injustice might arise. For instance, the record in this case shows that the horse was resold by Shaw. Where are the proceeds of this sale ? If an action had been maintained successfully against Croom by Shaw for damages, the former would have been entitled to an allowance or discount for such proceeds, as the verdict would have been for the difference between a sound and an unsound horse.
With these views, we are of opinion that the record in the case of Shaw vs. Swann was inadmissible as evidence further than as already stated, that there should have been evidence aliunde the record to show that Oliver was authorised by Croom to warrant the horse, and that he did warrant him in accordance with such instructions. If he, Oliver, warranted the horse hona fide, and fraud had been practiced upon him by Croom, he could look to Croom for redress. ' That Shaw having purchased of Oliver with a full knowledge of his agency, he should have proceeded, against Croom directly, and not against Oliver’s administrator.
We think the court below erred in not giving the instruction prayed for by defendant in the court below, and also, erred in giving the instructions it did on the trial of the case.
It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the judgment of the Court below be reversed, and that a venire de novo be awarded.
Per Curiam."
"James T. Archer, Assignee in Bankruptcy of William H. Francis, a Bankrupt, vs. Tho's Brown, William H. Brockenbrough, in right of his wife Ellen A. Brockenbrough, Administrators, &c. of Samuel H. Duval, Deceased",1 Fla. 219,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Bamczell, Justice:
To an action instituted by the plaintiff as assignee of Francis, on a judgment recovered against defendants, suggesting a devastavit, they plead — 1st, That they were not indebted. — 2dly, No such record. — 3dly, Reciting the bankrupt law of the United States as to the time of maintaining suits, &c. that the suit was not brought within two years after the decree of bankruptcy, and more than two years after the cause of action accrued. — ‘4th, That the suit was not brought within two years after the decree of bankruptcy, nor within two years after the cause of action accrued. — -5th, That the declaration and decree of bankruptcy was not made, nor. did the cause of suit accrue to plaintiff at any time within two years before his suit was brought. Plaintiff demurred to the 1st, 3d, 4th and 5th pleas, and took issue upon the second.
The court below adjudged the 1st, 4th, and 5th pleas to be sufficient, and overruled the 3d plea, declaring it to be insufficient. The issue on nul tiel record was tried, and found for plaintiff; but the other issues being with the defendants, the Court gave judgment in their favor. Plaintiff has assigned for error, the overruling the demurrer to the first, fourth, and fifth pleas, and giving judgment for defendants.
We are of opinion that the Court decided correctly as to the first plea. Nil debet as well as not guilty may be pleaded to an action suggesting a devastavit against executors. Williams on Executors, 1225. Coppin vs. Carter, 1 T. R. 402.
The sufficiency of the other pleas depends upon the proper construction of the 8th section of the act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States. This section provides, “ that the Circuit court in and for the District where the decree of bankruptcy is prayed, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the District Courts of all suits at law and equity, which may be brought by any assignee of the bankrupt, against any person or persons claiming an adverse interest, or by such person against such as-signee, touching any property or rights of property of said bankrupt, transferrable to, or vested in such assignee, and no suit at law or in equity shall in any case be maintainable by or against such assignee, or by or against any person claiming an adverse interest touching the property and rights of property aforesaid, in any court whatsoever, unless the same shall be brought within two years after the declaration and decree of bankruptcy, or after the cause of suit shall first have accrued.”
It is contended by plaintiff that this cause does not apply to or embrace the case of defendants, because there is not in question an adverse interest touching any property or right of property of the bankrupt. The act declares that “ no suit at law by such assignee shall in any case■ be maintainable in any court whatsoever, unless brought within two years.” If this be the correct reading of the text, the act is very explicit, and leaves no room for construction. It is true that the previous part of the section had provided for a concurrent jurisdiction of the Circuit with the District court “in all suits at law and in equity which may be brought by any assignee of the bankrupt against any person claiming an adverse interest, or by such person against such assignee touching any property or rights of property of said bankrupt, transferrable to or vested in such as-signee.” Confining the jurisdiction to the cases thus designated, yet is this designation both of Courts and persons, not only not continued, but expressly excluded by the usé of the terms in the clause of limitation-, “ no suit in any cause in any court whatever.” So also, whilst the preceding part of the act specifies suits brought by an assignee against persons claiming an adverse interest, this latter uses the terms “by such assignees,” without any qualification.
We are the better satisfied with this* view of the subject in consideration of the very peculiar character of this law, the object of which was to secure a prompt and efficient administration and settlement of the estate of all bankrupts, within a limited period. Thus by the 10th section, it is made the duty of the court “ to order and diréct a collection of the assets, and a reduction of the same to money, and a distribution thereof at as early periods as practicable,” — dividends are required to be made “ as often as once in six months from the time of the decree declaring bankruptcyand “ all the proceedings in bankruptcy in each case shall, if practicable, be ■finally adjusted, settled and brought to a close by the Court within two years after the decree declaring the bankruptcy.”
If will cease to be regarded as singular that the law requires the assignee to commence suits within two years, when by the same law it is made his duty to adjust, settle, and finally bring to a close, all the proceedings in the case within the same period. Concurring with the Court in overruling the demurrer to these pleas, it remains to enquire whether the court erred in giving judgment absolutely for defendants. By the Common Law, judgment followed the decision on a demurrer as matter of course, it being considered as a confession by matter of record of the facts pleaded. The law in force in this State, provides that “no demurrer shall be considered as an admission of the facts set forth in the pleadings demurred to, so as to bar the person demurring from any substantial claim or defence which he might have urged if said demurrer had not been filed.” Duval 95. If application had been made to the court below to withdraw the demurrer, and for permission to reply to the pleas, we do not hesitate to say that the Court should have granted it; but this was not done ; on the contrary, plaintiff has abided by his demurrer, by taking his writ of error. How then can this Court decide that the party has been barred from a substantial claim or defence he might have urged ? How determine that there is a substantial claim or defence when none has been preferred ?
It is at his option on overruling his demurrer, to withdraw it, or allow it to stand. If he does not withdraw it, it concludes his case. He is here entitled to the decision of this Court- on the correctness of the judgment overruling his demurrer, and could also have claimed our decision on a like judgment in overruling his motion to be permitted to reply to the pleas after the decision on his demurrer. The jurisdiction of the Court is appellate merely, to re-examine and to rejudge — to correct erroneous decisions already made — it is not a jurisdiction to determine in the first instance cases or questions which have not been submitted to the decision of the Judge below.
Being of opinion that there is no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court, it is ordered that the same be affirmed.!"
"T. Lane Betton, Trustee of Sarah Ann Betton, Claimant, vs. Jesse H. Willis and William P. Moseley, Plaintiffs in Execution",1 Fla. 226,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Douglas, C. Justice :
This case was brought up by an appeal from the Circuit Court of Leon county.
It was commenced in the late Superior Court for that county, and is a collateral proceeding arising out of the cases of William P. Moseley and Jesse H. Willis, plaintiffs in execution, against the exe-eutors of the last will and testament of A. M. Gatlin, deceased, and was instituted under the ninth and and tenth sections of “ an act concerning executions,” approved Feb. 17th, 1833. Duval’s Compilation, page 10. The ninth section provides — “ That when any marshal, sheriff, or other officer shall levy on goods and chattels claimed by any other 'person than the defendant, such person may make oath that said property belongs to him; and it shall be the duty of the officer to postpone any further proceédings under said levy until the right of property shall have been tried : Provided, the person claiming such goods and chattels, shall give bond with surety, to be approved by the marshal, sheriff, or other officer levy--ing the execution, payable to the plaintiff, in a penal sum of double the amount of the sum for which execution issued, conditioned to deliver said goods and chattels, upon demand of said officer, if the same shall be adjudged to be the property of the defendant in execution, and to pay the plaintiff all damages which the jury -4 on the trial of the right of property,’ may find in his favor, if it should appear to the jury that such claim was interposed for the. purpose of delay.”
Section 10, provides, that wheh an execution has been levied, and a claim to the property interposed as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the officer to return said execution to the next term of the Court whence it issued; together with such affidavit and bond; at which term a jury shall he sworn to try the right of property, “ and also, to give the plaintiff such damages, not exceeding twenty per cent, as may appear reasonable and right, in case of its appearing to the Jury that such claim was interposed for delay, and the court shall give judgment for the amount of damages so found.”
The 9th section above recited was amended by “ an act to amend the law in reference to executions and attachments,” approved 15th March, 1843, which provides, “that claim bonds, and replevin bonds, whether under execution or attachment, shall be for double the value of the property claimed, and not in double the amount of the execution or attachment.” See acts of 1843, pages 41 and 42. In all other respects it remains as originally enacted.
It appears by the record sent up, that on the 25th day of April, A. D. 1844, the said William P. Moseley recovered a judgment in the said Superior court against the said Executors, dec. of Alfred M.' Gatlin, deceased, and that on the fourth day of the succeeding month of May, Jesse H. Willis recovered in the same court another judgment against the same Executors, and that on the 15lh day of the same month, an execution was issued on each of the same judgments, which on the next day were placed in the hands of the marshal of the Middle District of Florida, and that he on the 16th day of the same month, levied said executions upon certain negro slaves, -which were claimed by T. Lane Betton, the present appellant, as Trustee of Sarah. Ann Betton, “ under a deed of trust and in virtue of a marriage settlement between the said Sarah Ann and Tur-butt R. Betton.” That the said T. Lane Betton gave bond to the marshal (as required by said 10th-section) in which bond the names of the slaves levied upon are stated, and' to which the appellant, T. Lane Betton, made oath in the following words, to wit: “Leon, ss. T. Lane Betton, trustee 'of Sarah Ann Betton, being duly sworn, sayS, the within specified slaves and property, belong to him as trustee of said Sarah, being assigned to her as her dower, and being in litigation, and that the same is not subject to levy and sale under said execution within mentioned.” ■
This execution, affidavit, and bond were returned by the marshal, according to the requirements of the 10th section of the act first above mentioned, and afterwards, to wit, at a Superior Court for the county of Leon, continued and held at the court house in the city of Tallahassee, on Friday the ninth day of May, A. D. 1845, “ a jury was sworn to try the right of property,” levied upon'by said plaintiffs in execution,"" who upon their oath' returned the following verdict, viz : “ We', the jury, find the property claimed to be the property of Alfred M. Gatlin, deceased, in the hands of Luke Lamb, executor, to be administered, and liable and subject to these executions.” Upon which verdict, judgment was entered as follows, to wit: — “ Therefore it is considered by the Court, that the plaintiffs in execution may proceed to execute the levys made as aforesaid, on the property aforesaid, ascertained by the jury to be liable and subject to these executions, and that they recover against the said claimants their costs'by them about their defence expended, and the said claimant in mercy, &c.”
The only error relied upon by the appellant is, that there is no issue in the case. And it is contended by them :—
1st, That without a formal issue joined, there was nothing for the jury to try, and that it was error to submit the matter to a jury without such an issue.
2d, That it does not appear by the record that the said executions were returned by the marshal as required by the 10th section of the act first above cited.
3d. That if the Court should be of the opinion that no formal issue was necessary, that at least the bond and executions ought to have been returned according to the provision of the statute, and to have appeared as pleadings in the cause — and
4th. That this is a statutory proceeding in derogation of the Common Law, and that a party proceeding under it should be held to a strict compliance with its provisions.
On the other hand it is insisted that there was a full compliance by the appellees with all the requirements of the statute. No authorities were cited on either side — no analagous. proceedings referred to.
The court fully recognizes the doctrine that where a summary remedy is given by statute, those who wish to avail themselves of it, must be confined strictly to its provisions, and shall take nothing by intendment. Logwood vs. Huntsville, 1 Minor’s Alabama Reps. 23. Childress vs. McGehee, Ibid. 131. Crawford vs. State, Ibid. 143. Yancey vs. Hawkins, Ibid. 171. Young vs. Martin, 2 Yeates, 312 ; and that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed. Commonwealth vs. Knobb, 9 Pick. 496. Lock vs. Miller, 3 Stew. & Port. 13. Melody vs. Reab, 4 Mass. 471-73. In giving a construction to a statute, the court must consider its policy and give it such an interpretation as may appear best calculated to advance its object by effectuating the design of the legislature. Allen vs. Parish, 3d Hammond, 198. The object here undoubtedly was a summary “ trial of the right of property,” levied on without a resort to the technical rules of special pleading.
What does the statute require ? We answer that it requires the claimant to make oath that the property levied on belongs to him, and to give bond with security, &c. , It also makes it the duty of the officer to return said execution to the next term of the court whence it issued, together with such affidavit and bond, and that a jury shall be sworn to try the right of property, and to give the plaintiff damages, &c.; and that the court shall give judgment for the amount of damages so found. These are all the requirements of the statute on the subject, and we are of opinion that these requirements were all substially (at least) complied with. The return of the executions, affidavit and bond were necessary to give the court jurisdiction in this case. McKnight vs. Smith, 5th Arkansas Reps. 410. The statute requires the officer to return them; but it is the interest as well as the duty of the claimant, to see that he does so. The return of these executions was essential to enable the Court to ascertain whether bond had been given according to law. It is not pretended that the bond and affidavit Were not duly returned ; but it is insisted that there is nothing to show that-the executions were thus returned. It appears, however, by the bill of exceptions in the record, that they were present and introduced as evidence on the trial of the right of property, by the claimant himself. The presumption therefore, is, that they were returned by the marshal according to law. The statute having made it his duty to return them, and being found in their proper place, it is to be presumed that they were properly returned, upon the principle that “ all things are presumed to be legitimately done till the contrary is proved.” Coke Lit. 232. And this presumption is rendered a moral and legal certainty by the fact, that the parties, by their attorneys, appeared at the said trial in the court below, and that no objection ""was there taken to the return of the marshal, or to the jurisdiction of the Court for want of such return. The court below having jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties before it, this Court will presume that all things necessary to give it jurisdiction had been done — nothing to the contrary appearing by the record. 5 Arkansas Reps. 411, 412. Thus far then, all that the statute requires to be done was done. We deem it unnecessary that the executions should appear as pleadings in the record. It is sufficient that they appear to have been duly returned. But if they should not thus appear, as the counsel for the claimant insists, whose duty was it to see that they did appear ?. The claimant was the actor in the court below.. The oñus probandi rested on him. He too, is the complainant in this Court, and it was incumbent on him to bring up a complete record. By the 7th rule of the practice, he was not entitled to be heard until a complete record was filed with the Clerk of this Court.
The only remaining question, and the more important one arises upon the error assigned — That there was no issue.” But this we think is met by the peculiar provision of the statute, which declares that “ a jury shall be sworn to try the right of property,” not to try the issue. Had the legislature intended that the strict rules of special pleading should be applied to this class of cases, the language would naturally have been “ a jury shall be sworn to try the issue,” and the manner of making up that issue (it is reasonable to suppose) would have been prescribed, as it was in case of garnishees. The oath required to he administered to the jury is inapplicable to a formal traverse, and shows that the Legislature did not intend to prescribe one. The 7th section of the act of 15th Feb. 1834, to amend the (above cited) act concerning executions, contains the provision in relation to garnishees just alluded to. It declares that “ whenever any person garnisheed, as is provided for by the seventeenth section of the act to which this is an amendment, shall deny or fail to answer in accordance with the provisions of the said section, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff in execution to traverse the said denial or answer, and the issue so made up shall forthwith be submitted to a jury for their decision.” Duval’s Comp. p. 13. This repeals no portion of the former act, but adds to it, and is to be considered as a part of it, and both must be construed together. Pearce vs. Atwood, 13th Mass. Reps. 324, 344.
The legislature having had the subject of issue before it, in relation to one summary collateral proceeding, provided for by this statute, and having made no provision for such an issue in the case of a claim to property levied on by execution, is evidence that it did not consider a formal issue necessary in such a case, and we do not think such an issue is required in the case before us. This is not a solitary instance of the swearing of a jury without such an issue upon the record. It is done in all cases brought up by appeal from Justices of the Peace to the Circuit courts in which the trial is de novo. And in all cases of judgment by default for want of a plea in the Circuit Courts, where the sum claimed is not certain, and cannot be rendered certain by calculation, a jury is sworn to enquire of the damages. And upon a writ of ad quod damnum, a jury is sworn to assess the damages. In the the two classes of cases last mentioned, there is of course no issue.
Upon the whole, we think there is no error in the judgment of the Court below, and it is'therefore affirmed with costs.
Per Curiam."
"T. Lane Betton, Trustee of Sarah Ann Betton, Claimant, vs. Union Bank of Florida, Plaintiff in Execution",1 Fla. 232,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Douglas, Chief Justice:
This cause was also brought up from Leon Circuit Court by ap. peal, and is in all respects similar in principle to the preceding case, and must be governed by the principles laid down in the opinion of the Court delivered in that case.
Indeed it was understood, to have been agreed by the respective counsel in these cases, that the one should abide the fate of the other.
The judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed with costs.
Per Curiam."
"Abner M. Sessions, who sues for the use of Hamilton W. Sharp vs. John Stevens",1 Fla. 233,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baltzem,, Justice:
This is a suit institued by Sessions against Stevens,' in the Court below, on a note for $106, payable the 1st of September, 1842, to Adam Wyrick, and by him assigned to plaintiff. The defence principally relied upon was, that “ defendant was served with a process of garnishment issued from the Superior Court of Jefferson county, upon a judgment and execution issued out of said court, in which James Branon was plaintiff, and said Wyrick was defendant, to answer concerning his indebtedness to said Wyrick, according to law, and upon such answer at November Term, 1844, of said court, judgment was rendered against said defendant for the amount due on the note, to wit, the sum of $71, and $3 94 costs, which record he brings into court, &c.” To this there was a replication'“that no such judgment as mentioned in said defendant’s plea, was obtained in favor of James Branon at said November Term, 1844.”
The Court below directed the jury that plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and the propriety of this instruction is now presented to the consideration of this Court by the assignment of errors. The instruction would seem to follow as a consequence from the state of the pleadings, and the successful maintenance by defendant of his plea of judgment recovered. A judgment against a garnishee, pri-ma facie, is a bar to a subsequent recovery of the same .note in the hands of any one. The law in such cases constitutes the execution creditor an assignee of the note from the time of the service of the notice of garnishment, and entitles him to judgment as if the note had been regularly assigned to him by act of the party, otherwise there would be the strange and extraordinary anomaly of a tribunal of justice committing an act of injustice, by compelling a party to pay twice on the same engagement.
Such judgment is the action of a court of competent and general jurisdiction, and is entitled to all the attributes of an adjudication upon the subject matter. By it, the note in legal contemplation, becomes extinguished, loses its identity and character-, and ceases to be the subject of future action. “It is evidence not only of the judgment, but of the right which it has decided.” 3 Peters’ Cir. Ct. Reps. 74. “A judgment in its-nature concludes the subject in which it is rendered, and pronounces the law of the case. It puts an end to all enquiries into the fact, by deciding it.” 3 Peters’ Reps. 204, 205.
If the plaintiff, instead of taking issue on the plea as to the existence of the judgment, had replied, that he was a bona fide holder of the note before service of the notice of garnishment, a different case might have been presented. 3 Pick. 67. But this was not done, and it is questionable whether such evidence was admissible on the trial. Yet the evidence shows the note to have been assigned after service of the notice. The assignment of the note bears date the year it became due. Omitting the day and the month, a suspicious circumstance, and the proof on the part of the defendant, was that Wyrick, the original holder in March, 1843, (the notice being served in February preceding,) asked payment of Stevens of the note. Stevens said he had been garnisheed. Wyrick asked for another note. Wyrick had it, and showed it to Stevens.” The plaintiff did not prove when or how he obtained the note. Under this state oí facts, we concur in the opinion with the Circuit Court as to the propriety of the instruction given.
It was objected that the notice of garnishment was illegal, there not being a return of “ no property” on the execution, which is made a pre-requisite by the statute to the issuing of notice of garnishment. That there was an irregularity in this respect, does not admit of doubt, and if the application had been made to the court rendering the judgment to set aside the notice, or objection had been made to the answer of the garnishee, the court would probably have quashed it, or excused him from answer. In case of overruling his objections, the party might have appealed, or had his writ of error. But this is his privilege, and he may waive it. By declining this course, he is presumed to have assented to it, nor is he or his assignee permitted to disturb the judgment afterward in another suit, presenting the question in a collateral manner. These principles will be found to be asserted in repeated decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Thus “ a court which is competent by its constitution to decide on its own jurisdiction, and to exercise it to a final judgment, without setting forth in its proceedings the facts and evidence on which it is rendered, whose record is absolute verity not to be impugned by averment or proof to the contrary, is of the description of courts whose judgments are conclusive if not removed to an appellate court. There can be no judicial inspection behind the judgment, save by appellate power.” Voorhees vs. Bank U. S. 10 Peters’ Rep. 479. Grignon’s Lessees vs. Astor, 2 How. 343. Considering this view of the subject conclusive, we have not deemed it necessary to notice the other points in the case ; being fully satisfied that the judgment should be affirmed — which is decreed accordingly."
"The Territory of Florida, for use of Wilkins C. Smith, surviving partner of Holloman & Smith, vs. William H. Redding, Elias E. Blackburn, Needham Bryan and Little Berry Parker",1 Fla. 242,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"BaIiTzel, Justice:
It is an established rule of pleading that “if the plaintiff by his replication show that he has no cause of action, there shall be judgment, though the bar be defective, for the Court will form their judg-ment from the whole record.” Arch. PI. & Ev. 240.
The replication of plaintiff to a plea by defendant of non damni-ficatus to debt on bond of Sheriff, sued as administrator by virtue of his office, assigns for breach, that while the said Redding was Sheriff and administrator ex officio of James K. Holloman deceased, he the said Redding received as such administrator as aforesaid, divers large sums of money and divers large quantities of goods and merchandize which he should have paid over and delivered to said Wilkins C. Smith as surviving partner of said Holloman.”
To this there was a demurrer, and we are of opinion it was rightfully sustained by the Court below. The design of the replication, as we conceive, is to show that as administrator of the deceased partner, the Sheriff had received this money and these goods and ■chattels. If so, the replication shows no cause of action in plaintiff.
On the death of a partner, the money, goods, and merchandize of the firm belong to the surviving partner, who is sole owner, and alone at law entitled to sue and be sued for them. Gow on Part. 143. The Sheriff as administrator obviously could not release or discharge an account against the partnership, nor had he the right to interfere with the affairs of the firm in any way, except to obtain the intestate’s share of the partnership property from the surviving partner after the settlement of the debts. He had no better right to meddle with these assets or effects than other property of the plaintiff; and plaintiff has no better right to sue him on his official bond than if the administrator had disturbed him in the possession of any property of his own. But there is another view of this subject entirely conclusive, without resting on this point.
Admitting that the Sheriff as administrator, was liable for this money and these assets, his securities on the administration bond are only liable after judgment of a court fixing the liability against him as administrator. 9 Mass. 114. 3 John. 437. 1 Wash. Rep. 31. 4 McCord 113.
For these reasons the judgment is affirmed with costs."
Cornelius Taylor vs. John Baker,1 Fla. 245,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baitzb^l, Justice:
This is a suit on an agreement by Taylor to pay Baker $300, “ provided he complies with an agreement made with me for his portion of land, which he is to receive from Government as an actual settler.”
The defence was, a failure of consideration, established, it is alleged, by a deed, the provisions of which are claimed to be in violation of an act of 'Congress. This deed (being the agreement referred to in the note sued on,) is first asserted to be in violation of the act of Congress, approved 4th August, 1842, “providing for the armed occupation and settlement of the unsettled part of the peninsula of East Florida”; but it was not in existence at the date of the deed, and can scarcely be construed to operate on a contract made prior to its passage.
The terms of the deed very clearly refer to an act in force at its date, and as the law granting pre-emption rights, approved 4th September, 1841, is the only one, to which we have been referred, as then in existence, its provisions must be regarded as having been in contemplation of the parties. The tenth section of that law provides, that “all assignments and transfers of the right hereby secured, prior to the issuing of the patent, shall be null and void;” and the question is presented, Whether the deed above alluded to, is in violation of this provision ? The law declares, “ assignments of rights secured to be void.” Now, such a right was only to be secured by a corn-pliance with the 10th and 12th sections, declaring, that “the person who has made, since the 1st of June, 1840, or shall make, a settlement on the public lands, &c., and inhabit and improve the same, and who has, or shall, erect a dwelling, such person shall be entitled to enter any number of acres, not exceeding 160, upon paying to the United States the minimum price of such land” — and, “prior to such entry, proof of the settlement and improvement, thereby required, shall be made to the satisfaction of the Register and Receiver, agreeably to such rules as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall be entitled to receive fifty cents from each applicant for his services; and all assignments and transfers of the right hereby secured, prior to the issuing of the patent, shall be null and void.”
The fair construction of the act would seem to be, that the assignment of the certificate of the Receiver, made after payment of the purchase money and proof of pre-emption, would be void: this would be the assignment of a right secured under, or by virtue of the act, and such the law invalidates.
But this is not the case under consideration. Here, there was no right secured; no money paid to the Government; and no proof of pre-emption. The subject was a bounty, not a right — a thing in ex-. pectancy, which the party agrees not to prosecute, but relinquishes and abandons, leaving it to his vendee to obtain it, if he chooses, for himself. An assignment of a pre-emption certificate, or a right secured under the pre-emption law, is usually very concise and simple, as, indeed, are generally most acts of assignment. Thus, “ for value received, I assign and transfer the within to A. B.” “ The words required in assignments are, grant, assign, and set over.”— 1 Jacob’s Law. Die. 140. 1 Inst. 301.
The deed, under consideration, has not the words “ assign, nor grant, nor set over”: its terms are, “remised, released, and quit claimed, that parcel of land due me, under an act giving a bounty, which bounty I relinquish and convey,” &c. The terms of the deed are appropriate to the transfer of a claim and improvement on the public lands, held under expectancy of a pre-emption, a relinquishment of the right, and a transfer of the possession and occupancy.
This view is confirmed by the 13th section, which provides, “that before any person claiming the benefit of this act, shall be allowed io enter such lands, he shall make oath before the Receiver or Register, that he hath not settled upon and improved the land to sell the same on speculation, but, in good faith, to appropriate it to his own exclusive use or benefit, and that he has not directly, or indirectly, made any agreement or contract with any person or persons whatsoever, by which the title he might acquire from the Government should enure, in whole or in part, to any person except himself.” It would have been the heighth of folly to have made a transfer or assignment in the hope of obtaining a pre-emption in defiance of this provision; nor can we intend that there was such design, whilst the instrument is capable of a different construction. It must be sustained, if possible: “ nt res magis valeat quam pereat” “ The construction shall be favorable; and, therefore, if words are susceptible of two senses, one agreeable to, and another against law, the former shall prevail. The Courts will, if possible, so construe an instrument that it may have some operation, rather than invalidate it on the ground of illegality.” 2 Black. Com. 279 — 380. Coke Litt. 42. Chitty on Cont. 20. Cowper, 714.
This view is also confirmed by the fact, that there is no evidence in the record showing that there was any application for a right of pre-emption by either of the parties, or that Taylor expected or relied, in any way, upon obtaining a pre-emption through the cultivation and improvement of Baber. Whilst coming to this conclusion, wé are free to declare, that if there had been proof of anything approaching to turpitude in the transaction, it would have produced a different result.
By the law of the Territorial Legislature, as early as 1822, the sale of improvements on the public lands was allowed and rendered valid, nor was there ever a disapproval by Congress, of this action of the Territorial Government. Duval Comp. 45.
Whilst we admit that there is a difference of opinion in some of the States of the Union, as to the validity of such sales, we desire to express our hearty concurrence in the sentiments expressed by the Supreme Court of Missouri, in the case of Clark vs. Shultz. The objection there, was, that the contract was not in writing, — an objection not prevailing here, — and the Court say, “ We feel the more inclined to .follow the New York decisions, and to leave the settlers free to dispose of their improvements, as of their horses and cattle. In truth, the very offer to sell the improvement, and give up accommodation and comfort, which the squatter has obtained for himself by his labor on the public lands, excludes altogether the idea that he intends, by the sale, to pass away any title or interest in the soil.— These improvements are often of much value to the new settler, and thb person making the improvement in building the cabin and clearing the field, is regarded by the Government as entitled to remuneration therefor, rather than as a trespasser, &c. It forms then, a good and sufficient consideration for any contract or price the purchaser may agree to pay for the possession of such improvements.” 4 Missouri, 235. 9 Missouri, 866. 5 John. 272.
“A man may renounce his possession, and such abandonment in favor of another, is a sufficient consideration to support the contract growing out of such renunciation or abandonment.” 9 Missouri, 866.
We are of opinion, then, that the relinquishment by Baker, of the expected bounty of the Government, the abandonment and surrender of his improvements, and the possession taken by Taylor, of themselves formed a good and valid consideration for the agreement, and were not prohibited by the act of Congress alluded to.
Another ground assumed, is, that plaintiff did not prove that he had fully complied with the agreement. This must allude to the provision, that “Baker shall serve out the time required of settlers bylaw, which entitles them to either donation or pre-emption”: but this provision would seem to be superseded by another engagement attached to the deed, and which is incorporated in the agreement sued on, that Baker was to work for the term of one year, and Taylor was to pay him f 300 for his year’s services and his share of the land, which is considered full payment for the whole.”
The first provision, left the time of service indefinite; the latter, made it certain, and was more favorable to Taylor, as by the preemption law, only a few weeks service was required to entitle a party to'its benefits. But, supposing the first provision in force, we are not prepared to say that there is no evidence to prove a performance; on the contrary, we see little room to doubt the sufficiency of the proof in this respect.
Again, it is maintained, that there was a plea to the second and third counts, which was demurred to; and, as the demurrer was not disposed of, these counts, referring alone to the land, must be regarded as not in issue. The plea alluded to is, in effect, the general issue, which had already been filed, and gave to defendant no new advantage which he had not secured by that plea. It seems not to have been relied upon by the parties, and was properly treated as a nullity. And here we take occasion to say, that it is not enough in this Court, to shew that a plea was on file in the Court below: the party complaining, must go further, and shew that that Court either refused to act upon the pleading, or decided it wrongfully; otherwise, this Court would lose its appropriate office of an appellate tribunal, by deciding, originally, questions never raised in the Court below, and which, if presented, would probably have been correctly decided there.
The view we have taken of this case, is so strongly fortified by the other testimony in the record, as. to leave us entirely satisfied with the justice and equity of the verdict and the decision of the Court.
The services of Baker for the year, are estimated by one witness at $300, and by one of the defendant’s witnesses at $200 and his clothes, and $300 is the entire1 consideration for the improvement and services, both.
Upon the whole case, we are of opinion, that the judgment be affirmed with costs. Hawkiks, Justice,
dissenting:
With due deference to the opinion pronounced in this case, I feel constrained to differ with the majority of the Court as to its conclusions of law, and also as to what constitutes the subject matter and consideration of the agreement, upon which the suit was instituted. It would appear by the evidence in the cause, that on the thirtieth day of May, 1842, Baker executed to Taylor, in substance, the following instrument:
Know all men, that I, John Baker, for and in consideration of the sum of three hundred dollars, to me in hand paid by C. Taylor, have remised, released, and quit claimed, and by these presents do remise, release, and quit claim to said Taylor, his heirs, &c., all that certain lot or parcel of land, to me due by the United States’ Government, under an act giving and granting to actual settlers within the country claimed and possessed by the Indians, a bounty of one hundred and sixty acres of land, which said bounty of one hundred and sixty acres of land, for the consideration .above mentioned, and'by these presents I relinquish and convey to the said C. Taylor, with all my right, title and interest, claim and demand unto or in anywise appertaining, together with all and singular the hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and the remainder and remainders, reversion, and reversions, rights, profits and issues thereof. It is further understood, that I, the said John Baker shall serve out the time required, of settlers by law, which entitles them to either donation or pre-emption as the case may be. To have and to hold the aforesaid bargained premises to him the said C. Taylor, &c.
(Signed,) JOHN BAKER.
“ It is further understood, and by these presents agreed, that I, John Baker shall and will work for the said C. Taylor, for the term of one year, and the said Taylor is to pay me three hundred dollars for his year’s services and his share of .the land aforesaid, which sum is considered as full payment for the whole.”
Simultaneously with this instrument, the following agreement was entered into by Taylor:
“I promise to pay to John Baker, on or before the first day of January, 1843, the sum of three hundred dollars, provided he complies with an agreement made with me for his portion of land which he is to receive from Government as an actual settler, as also for his year’s services. May 30, 1842. “ C. TAYLOR.”
The first of these instruments is inartificially drawn, and somewhat vague in its terms; and where this is the case, it is always difficult to arrive at the true meaning of parties. In construing agreements, for the purpose of ascertaining their intention, we may look at concomitant matters and circumstances, if, by a view of the instrument, they may seem to have had a relation to, or connexion with the subject matter of the contract. Upon an inspection of the paper alluded to, I incline to the opinion, that it was an agreement for land that Baker might have become entitled to, under what is ordinarily termed the armed occupation bill; and I have come to this conclusion, not only owing to the intention fairly to be inferred, as I think, from the face of the instrument, but also that, at the time this agreement was entered into, the bill referred to was before Congress. Its passage was the subject of notoriety and discussion, a theme of general concern to the people of the (then) Territory, and one of peculiar interest to those who wished to avail themselves of the provisions of the bill, whenever it should become a law. I think, therefore, that this anticipated law was in contemplation of the parties to this instrument, as it does not seem to have direct reference to the pre-emption law. I think the phraseology of the instrument sustains me in the view I have taken, and that it was not a right of pre-emption that Baker intended selling tó Taylor. The words of the agreement are, “ all that certain lot or parcel of land, to me due by the United States Government, vnder an act giving and granting to actual settlers within the country claimed and possessed by the Indians.” Now, there was no such act in existence at the time of the contract; and, in the preemption law, it appears that settlements are to be made on those public lands to which.the'Indian title had been, at the time of such settlement, extinguished. It is true, the words of the agreement would seem to apply to an existing act, and Baker speaks of the land due him by the Government, under an act giving and granting to actual settlers, &c.; but, at the same time, he uses the words “do remise, release and quit claim,” and yet he clearly had no pre-emption or other right at'the time, but he conveys only that which he shall af-terwards acquire. I consider that all these words, though in presentí, are, as to their effect, prospective, and apply as strongly to the anticipated act of Congress, as to the terms of the contract.
Besides, Baker agrees “ to serve out the time required of settlers by-hw, which entitles him to either donation or pre-emption, as the case may be.” No time is required by the pre-emption law to enable settlers to make their entries, and I think that the words “ .donation or pre-emption, as the case may be,” convey the idea that there was something contingent or alternative, that there was an uncertainty as to the form or manner in which the bounty of the Government was to be bestowed. If the language of the agreement was intended to apply to the pre-emption act, would it not have been explicit and definite, and alluded to it in clear and precise terms ? The passages I have particularly adverted to, in conjunction with the whole tenor of the transaction^ impress me with the conviction, that the contract was made with a view to the passage of the armed occupation bill.
The views I have thus expressed, I confess I have taken with some difiidence, owing to the difficulty I have before alluded to, in ascertaining the true and real intentions of parties, where the instrument is vague and uncertain in its terms, and I feel this diffidence increased when my opinions are not in. unison with those of my brethren on the Bench. ,
If I am correct in the view I have taken of the subject, the contract between Baker and Taylor, even if legal at the time, became illegal by virtue of the “ act to provide for the armed occupation and settlement of the unsettled part of the peninsula of East Florida,” for by the fourth section of that act, it is declared, “ That all sales, gifts, devises, agreements, &c. to sell transfers or liens, whatsoever, pri. vate or judicial, of the lands or any portion thereof acquired by this act, made at any time before patents shall have issued for the same, shall be utterly void and without effect, to every intent and purpose, whether in law or equity.” Even if the contract had not been illegal at the time, as I have before remarked, and became so after-wards by act of law, still it cannot be enforced. 10 East. 530. 3 M. and S. 267.
If, on the other hand, I am wrong in the view I have taken of the contract, and it does relate to the pre-emption law, still, I think, the action should not have been sustained, if being void for want of a good and legal consideration. A portion of it being founded on an illegal consideration, and the contract being an entirety, the whole of it becomes illegal.
There was clearly not the least shadow of title to the land conveyed, or agreed to be conveyed to Taylor, and the bare and naked improvements made by Baker, were all which were pretended to be conveyed. There are authorities which certainly go the length to say, that the sale of improvements on public lands, is a good consideration for a promise; but I agree with the opposite decisions, thinking they are founded on the true notions of law and public policy.
In Merrill vs. Le Grand, 1 Howard Mis. R. 150, it was decided, that a promissory note given in consideration of the purchase of an improvement upon vacant government land, is for an illegal consideration, and cannot be recovered.
Persons settled upon the lands of the United States, without a right of pre-emption, are made trespassers, and an agreement to transfer their possession would be an agreement for the continuance of a trespass, and would be illegal and void.
So in Carr vs. Allison, 5 Blackford, 63, a bond was given in 1833, in payment of a certain sum, in consideration of an improvement previously made on United States’ land, and of the obligee’s promise not to enter the land on which the improvement was made. The preemption law of the United States, in force in February, 1833, did not authorize the transfer of a pre-emption right before a patent had issued for the land. It was held, that the improvement was not a valid consideration for the bond, and that the promise not to enter the land was void as against public policy. See also, 4 Yerger, 1, 3.
These sales, or transfers, are clearly against the policy of the statute, which seems to have had for its object the protection of bona fide settlers from the grasp or imposition of capitalists or speculators.— Among the requisites as prescribed by the pre-emption law of 1841, is that the party,«before claiming the benefit of the áct-by entering the land, shall swear that he has not entered upon and improved the land to sell the same on speculation, hut in good faith to appropriate it to his own exclusive use or benefit. Any attempt to contravene the policy of a public statute, should not meet with the aid of law to give it success, or enforce a contract which may be the result of such intended contravention;' The statute of 1841, declares, “that all assignments and transfers of the right hereby secured,” (that is,, after the' requisites of law have been complied with) prior to the issuing of the patent, shall be null and void.” If these transfers, even after the right is secured, are void, I should suppose also, that transfers and assignments without the right secured, would be equally so. All these pre-emption rights are mere bounties to settlers, to encourage the settlement of the public domain. They would seem to be privileges confined to the person, and incapable of assignment, so as to form a legal consideration for their sale or transfer.
The various States may certainly legislate as to the remediies in their own tribunals, and regulate the disposal of the property'of their own citizens; but Congress, by the Constitution, has the sole power of disposal of the public lands, and of making all needful rules and regulations thereto. See 13 Pet. U. S. R. 498.
I cannot perceive, therefore, how a State enactment can regulate the sale of portions of the public domain, or legislate in regard to rights growing out of it. And, in point of morals, I can see no difference whether the Government, or an individual, is owner of the land upon which improvements are made, and attempted to be sold.
I deem it my duty, upon this occasion, further to remark, that I cannot assent to the proposition so broadly laid down, that “ the Court would lose its appropriate office of an appellate tribunal by deciding, originally, questions never raised in the Court below, and which, if presented, would perhaps have been correctly decided there.” The case is before us upon the errors apparent upon the record; but I do not propose to discuss this question in reference to its bearing upon the case at bar, but to manifest my dissent to it as a general proposition, which, as it is laid down, may reach all future cases, and preclude this Court from looking into any error not presented in the Court below, although that error might shew that the cause of action had entirely failed. Such an error, if presented in the Court below, if is to be presumed would have been corrected there; but ifj because in the hurry of a trial at nisi prius, it has escaped the attention of both the Counsel and the Court, are we precluded from deciding it here 1 In the case of Powell vs. Waters, 8 Cowen, 701, Spencer, Senator, said, that, “ If the foundation of the action had manifestly failed, we cannot, without shocking all common sense of justice, allow a recovery to stand.” And it is worthy of our serious consideration, how far we can constitutionally disregard a manifest and palpable error on face of the record which is presented to us, whether that defect has been pointed out in the Court below, or insisted upon in this Court, or not. As was remarked by the Judge, who gave the opinion of the Court, in 14 John. R. 501 — 517: “ The object of Counsel is to aid the Court in its investigations, and it would be strange if the Court were bound to shut their eyes upon every point not suggested by them — it would make the rights of parties depend more upon the vigilance and ability of Counsel, than on the law of the land.” Judges must decide according to the law; and if it is not presented to them by Counsel, or their attention is not called to the true points of a case, still, if they themselves discover those points, or ascertain the law, they are bound by their obligations to pronounce it. In the case of Baird & Co. vs. Mattox, 1 Call, 257, the Court said: “ If the defendant is sued as heir, or devisee, and pleads that he has no assets by descent, on which plaintiff takes issue, and verdict be found for the defendant, a repleader will be awarded (by the Appellate Court, though not prayed in the Court below,) because the issue has only tried the right as to descent, and not as to the demise”; and, in Speaks vs. Shepherd, 6 Harr, and John. 84 — 86—87, it was held, that upon a writ of error, the Court are not only authorized, but bound to examine the whole record, and if there be error, it is their duty to reverse the judgment below, although the Court were right in the opin. ion they gave on the particular point upon which their opinion is prayed, and 7 Bacon Abr. 448, is cited to sustain this position.
There can be no doubt (said Mr. Justice Woodbury, in delivering the opinion of the Court in the case of Garland vs. Davis, 4 Howard S. C. R. 143,) that exceptions to the opinions given by Courts below, must be all taken at the time the opinions are pronounced. But it is equally clear, that when the whole record is before the Court above, any exception appearing upon it can be taken by Counsel, which could have been taken in the Court below, and the case of Roach vs. Hulings, 16 Peters, 319, is cited, which sustains the first proposition.
So, it is the duty of the Court to give judgment on the whole record, and not merely on the points started by Counsel. Slacum vs. Pomeroy, 6 Cranch, 221. 16 Peters, 319, Garland vs. Davis, 4 Howard S. C. R. 143. In the case of the United States vs. Burn-ham, 1 Mason C. C. Reports, 62, the Court alone took notice of the defect, which was the sole ground of its opinion; and Judge Story, who pronounced the opinion of the Court, said, “ The Court must pronounce upon the whole record”: and in the case of Patterson vs. The United States, 2 Wheat. 221, Justice Washington says: “ The Court considers it unnecessary to decide the questions argued at the bar,-as the verdict is so defective, that no judgment can be rendered upon it,” and upon that account the proceedings below were reversed. Harrison et al vs. Nixon, 9 Peters, 483 — 535, is also in point, and see Stephens on this doctrine.
in the case of Slacum vs. Pomeroy, 6 Cranch, 222, before cited, Chief Justice Marshall said : “It is not too late to allege as error in this Court, a fault in the declaration, which ought to have prevented the rendition of the judgment in the Court below.”'
I have thought proper to be thus prolix, lest I might, by my silence on the subject now, be precluded in a future case from noticing a vital error in the record, merely because it was not presented in the Court below, and which, from the views I entertain of my constitutional duty, I should not feel at liberty to disregard."
"George W. Phillips, Claimant, vs. Whitehurst J. Hawkins, Plaintiff in Execution",1 Fla. 262,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Baltzell, Justice:
■ This is an appeal from a trial of the right of property in a negro woman Dolly, had under the laws of the State permitting a-party, whose property is levied upon under execution or attachment, to have a trial of the right, on presenting an affidavit and giving bond as required by the statute.
Sadbury, the original owner of the property, on the 4th May, 1842, mortgaged it to Uz Wood, “ to pay all of certain notes on which Wood was security, together with interest, &c., so that Wood shall in no way be interrupted or injured in consequence of his having become security thereon, or shall, by any other lawful means, keep and save harmless said Wood, from the payment of said notes or any part thereof, and all costs, damages and charges, as security,” &c.
About the 2d of July, 1845, (for the bill of sale has no date,) Wood, “ for the consideration of $500, sold and Conveyed to Phillips the ne. gro in question, as mortgagee. ”
Sadbury, by bill of sale dated 80th June, 1845, reciting the mort. gage, and “ that Wood had been compelled by process of law to expend and advance, as surety or endorser, certain sums of money to more than the value of the said negro woman: to reimburse Wood, and to save the expense of a suit to foreclose, and willing that a sale should be effected by private arrangement, he gives his assent to the sale to Phillips, and renounces and releases all right, title and interest in the said negro slave.”
On the trial it was admitted that the $616 29, paid on a case of Wm. Williams, one of the debts enumerated in the mortgage, was paid on a security debt of Sadbury.
The plaintiff in execution, contesting the claim of Phillips, relies on an execution from the Superior Court of Gadsden county, against Wood & Sadbury, for the sum of $795 04, with interest, &c., levied upon this negro woman and her child, the 4th of August, 1845.
The question is, Who has the better title ? It is too well established both by the English and American authorities, to admit of ques-tipn, that, “ on failure by a mortgagor to comply with the condition of the mortgage, the title in personal property becomes absolute in the mortgagee, and he may reduce it to possession.” 4 Kent, 138-9. Pow. on Mort. 3. 2 Vesey Jr. 378. 10 John. 471. Brown vs. Bement, 8 John. 96. 5 John. 258. 2 Pickering, 610. 7 Cowen, 290. So, “ his interest may be levied on and sold under execution.”
The case of Ferguson vs. Lee, is precisely in point. “ C. Lee had a mortgage upon personal property, which became absolute on the 1st of December, 1828. The property, therefore, became Ms on that day, as the mortgage was then forfeited. Subsequent to that day, the deputy Sherifflevied on the property, as the property of C. Lee — the levy was good and held the property.” 9 Wendell, 258.
In thq case under consideration, claimant asserts a forfeiture of the mortgage, by producing the deed of Sadbury, which admits, “ that Wood had been compelled, by process of law, to expend and advance as endorser, sums of money to more than the value of the woman.” The title in the negro woman was then absolute and complete in Wood at the date of the bill of sale, and was subject to the execution of Phillips, it being operative and in force at that time.
We do' not conceive it necessary to go into a more minute consideration of the case, either as to the instructions given, or those re. fused, satisfied that the right is with the plaintiff, and that the verdict was properly rmijtered. We see no objection to the instruction given by the Court below. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed with costs."
"Chancey Ward and Charles P. May, Partners, &c., trading as Ward & May, for the use of Joseph F. Crosby, vs. Jabez B. Bull and Richard A. Shine",1 Fla. 271,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Douglass, Justice:
This is an action of assumpsit, and was brought up from the Cir-Court of Leon county by Writ of Error. The declaration contains two counts:
First — Money lent and advanced, money paid, laid out and expended, and money had and received.
Second — For use and occupation. Plea, non assumpsit.
A Jury, to assess the damages, was waived by the parties to the suit by their respective attorneys, and the facts were submitted to the Court for its decision, pursuant to the provision contained in the first section of the act of November 21st, 1829, “ To amend an act regulating judicial proceedings.” Duval’s Compilation, page 105. The plaintiffs having introduced their testimony rested.
Whereupon the defendants, by their counsel, demurred to the evidence óf the plaintiffs; and the plaintiffs, by their counsel, having put in their joinder to the demurrer, “ all the matters of law and of fact were submitted to the Court for its decision.” The demurrer brought upon the record the following proof:
1st. A lease, by one William Wyatt, to the plaintiffs in error, which is as follows, viz.:
“ This Indenture, made this the 10th day of February, A. D. eighteen hundred and forty, between William Wyatt of Leon county, Territory of Florida, of the one part, and Ward & May, merchants, in the county and Territory aforesaid, of the other part, witnesseth :— That the party of the first part, has rented and. leased to the parties of the second part, the new brick store, south of F. Towle’s building, on one hundred foot street, at four hundred dollars for the first year, and four hundred and fifty dollars 'for the three succeeding years, with the refusal of the same, after the expiration of that time, at a fair rent: the party, of the second, to have possession by the first of May next, when the rent is to commence. The parties'of the second part are to pay the party of the first part, his heirs and assigns, the aforesaid rent in quarterly instalments. The party of the first part, is to counter and shelve with drawers the said store, as per plan annexed. It is further understood, that whatever other improvements the parties of the second part may make in the said store, shall be at the expense of the second party; but with the understanding and agreement, that the party of the first part shall, on the removal of the parties of the second part, pay the cost of all such improvements, or allow them to be removed by the second parties.” The only additional proof which the record discloses, is that, “ on 1st May, 1843, plaintiffs paid $450, in Union Bank bills, worth 33J cents in the dollar in good funds, in advance for rent up to 1st May, 1844 : on the 25th May, 1843, the store was destroyed by fire: on the 15th of July, 1843, the defendants commenced the erection of a new building on the lot and site where the store stood, which being completed, was on the 5th of December, 1843, re-leased by defendants to a third person, at the rate of $325 per annum, in good funds, and the rent received by them to 1st May, 1844, and afterwards; the plaintiffs being out of the country after the fire. The defendants offered the plaintiffs to pay them, or refund them rent from the 5th December, 1843, at the same rate which they had received, say, $450 per annum, in Union Bank funds, of the value of 33J cents per dollar.”
The Court, having duly considered all the matters of law and fact referred to it, proceeded to render judgment as follows, to wit:
“ It appears to the Court, that the matters shewn in evidence by the plaintiffs, are sufficient in law to maintain the issue joined herein ; and it being by consent of parties referred to the Court to assess the damages which the plaintiffs had sustained, by reason of the matter shewn in evidence as aforesaid; it is therefore considered by the Court, that the plaintiffs do recover from the said defendants the sum of sixty dollars and forty-two cents, the damages which the said plaintiffs have sustained by reason of the matter shewn in evidence as aforesaid, and their costs by them about their suit in this behalf expended, and the said defendants in mercy,” &c.
Whereupon the said defendants, by their attorney, filed their Bill of Exceptions, &c. ' .
The plaintiffs in error took no exceptions; but being dissatisfied with the amount of their judgment, have brought it up to this Court for revision. • No errors are in form assigned. The counsel for the plaintiffs in error, however, insists that the Court errfed in not giving judgment for a larger amount ,• and this, they contend, is entirely a question of law, and ask the Court to give such judgment as the Court below ought to have given. That a party may bring a writ of error to reverse his own judgment for error, if injustice has been done him in the Court below, is well settled. Ingalls vs. Lord, 1 Cowen, 240. Sarles vs. Hyatt, ibid, 253. Capron vs. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch, 126. Teal vs. Russell, 2 Scammon, 32. Johnson vs. Jebb, 3 Burr, 1772. Tidd’s Pr. 1134. Bissell vs. Marshal, 6 John. 100. Nor is there any doubt that the Court may proceed to give such judgment as the Court below ought to have given, if the case is properly before us for that purpose. Duval’s Comp. 109, sec. 5. 2 Bac. Abr.
503. But this Court can only reverse a judgment for error in law, not for error in fact. Upon a writ of error, containing error in fact and error in law, the Court ordered the error in fact to be stricken out, and reversed the judgment for error in law. Lewis vs. Lawson, 1 Root, 162. In the case of Neilson vs. McCabe, 9 Missouri Reps. 48, and Von Pheel vs. The City of St. Louis, ibid, 49, the Supreme Court of Missouri held, that the decision of the Circuit Court, sitting as a Jury, will not be set aside, unless,the record shows, that the Circuit Court was called upon to decide some question of law, and its decision was wrong. Those cases were followed by that of Young vs. Kelly, in the same Court, where the same principle was maintained, and the Court said: “ In a case like this, where the Court discharges the duty of a Jury, as well as its' own peculiar duty, it seems more particularly necessary that the appellant should call oh the Court to decide the law arising on the faGts detailed in evidence. No such decision being made, this Court feels no disposition to disturb the verdict of the Court sitting as a Jury.” In the case of Reynolds vs. Rogers, 5th Hammond, 169, the Court held, that where matter of fact was submitted to the decision of the Court, neither party could sustain a writ of error, and the cases of Dovenor vs. Swafford, 1 Scammon, 166, Gilmore vs. Ballard, ibid, 252, and Stringer vs. John & Wm. Smith, ibid, 295, are all in point. An appeal, or writ of error, (the Court said, in the cases of Gilmore vs. Ballard, and Dovenor vs. Swafford,) if recognized in such cases, would be equivalent to a new mode of obtaining a new trial. It undoubtedly would be so, and we are not disposed to countenance this mode of practice. In the case last cited, the Court remarked: “ It is of importance that innovations on the rules of proceeding should not be sanctioned, and that those which are found, after long use and practice, to be best adapted to the decision of causes, should be adhered to.” A proposition founded in good sense and reason, and to which we. most fully assent. The correct rule in the cases tried by the Court sitting as a Jury, would seem to be, that where facts alone, are submitted, and the Court has only to weigh the evidence and determine accordingly, no writ of error lies: and where mixed questions of law and fact are presented to the Court for its decision, no writ of error lies, unless the Court is called upon to decide questions of law, or such question of law necessarily arises out of the facts, and is distinctly presented to the Court upon them, so that the decision of the point'of law will decide the merits of the cause, and the decision of the Court is wrong. In this case, the facts were distinctly presented to-the Court by the demurrer to the evidence, and several questions of law were incidentally involved in determining the rights of the parties upon them, as connected with the facts of the case; but no particular question involving the whole, or to any great extent the merits of the cause, was prominently and distinctly presented to the Court by counsel, nor did any such necessarily arise out of the evidence, so as to make a decision upon it the subject of a writ of error. The remedy of the plaintiff, if.the verdict was too low, was a motion for a new trial in the Court below, upon which all these incidental questions might have ■been heard. And here we might with propriety stop; but this case has been pressed upon the Court by the counsel for the plaintiffs, with a zeal and earnestness which evinces his confidence in the justice of his clients’ claim to a reversal of'this judgment, and is deserving of further notice from us; and we, therefore, proceed to give our views briefly upon the merits.
The only question of law expressly raised, and distinctly presented to the Court in this case, was decided in favor of the plaintiffs in error, and a writ of error will not lie in favor of the party applying. Sterrett vs. Creed, 2 Hamm. 343. Tribue vs. McKiterick, 4 Bibb. 180. Hammond vs. Buttell, 1 Call, 567. Hughes vs. Stickney, 13 Wend. 280. Henry vs. Smoot, Minor, 18. Carry vs. The State, 4 Port. 186. Indeed, the plaintiffs in error do not complain of that,decision, but only that the amount found by the Court to be due to the plaintiffs, and for which judgment was rendered in the Court below, is too small. In order to determine the correctness of this proposition, and ascertain the rights of the plaintiffs in error in this suit, we must look to the nature of the action, and the circumstances of the case as disclosed by the evidence.
The declaration, as before stated, contains two counts; one, for money had and received, and the other, for use and occupation. We will reverse the order, and enquire, first, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover on the last count. This count is founded on the statute of 11 Geo. 2., chap. 19, sec. 14, by which it is enacted, that fl it shall be lawful for a landlord, where the agreement is not by deed, to recover a reasonable satisfaction for the lands and tenements, or hereditaments, held or occupied by the defendant in an action on the case, for the use and occupation of what was so held and enjoyed; and if in evidence, on the trial of such action, any parole demise, or any agreement (not being by deed,) where a certain rent is reserved, shall appear, the plaintiff in such action shall not, therefore, be non-suited, but may make use thereof, as an evidence of the quantum of damages to be recovered.” Chitty on Contracts, 105 — 106. 1 Chitty’s PI. 338.
Assumpsit for the use of land by permission and assent of the plaintiff, or an express promise to pay a certain sum, or, in general, to pay to the plaintiff’s satisfaction for such use, dies, at common law, independent of the statute. Eppes vs. Call, et ux. 4 Hen. & Munf. 161. And it has also been held to lie on an implied promise : Sutton vs. Mandeville, 1 Munf. 407. Gunn vs. Scovie, 4 Day, 299.— Logan vs. Lewis, 1 J. J. Marsh. 3. But, to support an action for use and occupation, a demise must be shewn, or some evidence given to establish the relation between the parties of landlord and tenant.

Featherstonehaugh vs. Bradshaw, 1 Wend. 134.— Smith vs. Stewart, 6 John. 46. Story on Contracts, p, 398, sec. 656. There is nothing in the evidence in this case, which shews a contract, either express or implied, on the part of the defendants in er-f ror to pay rent for the premises in question, to the plaintiffs in error. They only offered to return the amount of the rent which they had received for the time that intervened between the 5th of December, 1843, and the first day of May, 1844. The plaintiffs in error cannot, therefore', recover on that count, but must fall back upon their count for money had and received, to recover back the rent which they had advanced. There is no evidence either of money lent or advanced, or money paid, laid out, or expended. The charge for money had and received, is therefore the only one on which the plaintiffs in error can rest their case. This kind of equitable action, to recover back money which ought not in justice to be kept, it is said, is very beneficial, and therefore much encouraged. Chitty on Contracts, 182. It lies only for money, which “ex aequo et bono”, the defendant ought to refund. 3 Tucker’s Blackstone, 163. 1 Chitty’s'. Pl. 341. Chitty on Contracts, 182. By bringing this action the tort is waived. 2 Smith’s leading cases, page top 131, side 89.— What then, are the plaintiffs in error entitled to recover on this count? A lessee who covenants to pay rent and repair, with express exception of casualties by fire, is liable upon the covenant for rent, though the premises are burned down and not rebuilt by the lessor after notice. Story on Contracts, page 376, sec. 605. Towle vs. Bate, 6 Mass. 63. Izon vs. Garton, 5 Bing. New Cases, 501. Balfour vs. Weston, 1 Term R. 311. And a Court of Equity will not restrain him from suing for the rent. Leeds vs. Cheetham, 1 Sim. 145. Haltzapffel vs. Baker, 18 Ves. Jr. 117. Balfour vs. Weston. 1 T. R. 312. At the trial of this last case, Buller, Justice, read the following note of the case of Pindar against Ainsley and Rut-ter, at the sittings at. Westminster, after Michaelmas Term, 1767. That was an action of ejectment, by the tenant against the landlord, to recover the possession of some houses which had been burned down during the term, and rebuilt by the landlord. In the lease there was an express covenant, on the part of the tenant, to pay rent; but he had paid none subsequent to the time of the fire. Lord Mansfield, before whom the cause was tried, said, the consequence of the house being burned down is, that the landlord is not obliged to rebuild, but the tenant is obliged to pay rent during the whole term. The premises consisted of houses only, and the fire has made them quite useless. In March, 1763, the premises were worth nothing; but the landlord, if he had insisted on the rigor of the law, might have obliged the plaintiff to pay the rent for nothing, during the remainder of the term. Then the plaintiff would have been glad to have delivered up the premises ; therefore he left it to the jury to consider, whether it was not to be presumed that the tenant had abandoned the lease at the time of the fire, and, accordingly, the defendant had a verdict. So, in the casé before us: the store being burned down, the defendants in error were not bound to rebuild; but the plaintiffs in error were bound, by their express covenant, for the rent during the whole term; and although they had paid it in advance, had no claim to recover it back. On the 25th of May, the house was burned down- The premises, for aught that appears, consisted of the store only. From that time to the 5th of December, they were worth nothing. The landlords (the defendants in error,) might have laid by during the remainder of the term; in which case the plaintiffs in error would have lost their money entirely. . They would have had no claim to recover any part of it. The idea, that the defendants in error were bailors, and bound to keep the bricks and mortar (the rubbish left by the burning of the store,) in repair, as argued by the counsel'for the plaintiffs in error, seems to the Court a fallacy. On the contrary, if the defendants in error were bailors, the plaintiffs in error were bailees, and bound to take such care of the property as a prudent man would take of his own affairs. Story on Bailments, 8 — 16. 1 Smith’s leading cases, 100. 2 Jones on Bailments, 6 — 110—119. Tomkins vs. Saltworth, 14 Sarg. <fe Rawle, 775. It does not appear, however, that they took any care of it, or paid any regard to it after the fire. They were out of the country, and do not appear to have left any agent to attend to it. The bricks and mortar, so frequently spoken of at the hearing, were not the property of the lessees, nor could they have used them without the consent of the lessors. Upon the whole circumstances of this case, we think there was quite as strong'grounds for the Judge who tried this cause in the Court below, to presume that the defendants in error entered to rebuild the store by the assent of the plaintiffs in error, that they might have the benefit of the return of their rent they had paid from the time the new store should be completed, (as it was the only way in which they could get any thing,) as there was in the case of Pindar against Ainesly & Rutter, for Lord Mansfield to leave it to the jury to consider, whether the tenant had not abandoned the lease. It was insisted, however, on behalf of the plaintiffs in error, that they were entitled to all the rent of the new store for the tinje intervening between the 5th day of December, 1843, and the first day of May, 1844; but there is no proof as to the relative value of the old store and the new one. The latter may, for aught that appears, have been worth ten times as much as the former. This is an equitable action. We must look at the finding of the Court as though it had been the finding of a Jury, and presume that he took into consideration all the equitable circumstances which he might properly have left to a Jury to consider, had that mode of trial been adopted. There was no eviction in this case, for that can only be by title paramount. Bac. Abr. title Rent, 1. Saunders R. 204, n. 2. Ibidem, 322, n. a. 4 Kent’s Comm. 462. 2 Jac. L. Diet. 444. There was no expulsion from the store, for it was gone. There was no actual expulsion from the ground on which it stood, for the lessees had left, not only the premises, but the country. There is no trespass — no tort, for that is waived by the bringing of this action. On the 5th of December, 1843, the new store was leased, and from that time the plaintiffs in error were entitled, upon the principles we have assumed, to a return of the rent they had paid, at the rate at which the defendants in error had received it. Until that time the premises, so far as rent was concerned, were valueless. The loss, must fall either upon the lessors, or lessees; and there is no more equity that the landlord should bear it, than the tenant. When the tenant (as in this case,) has expressly covenanted to pay rent, and when the landlord must bear the loss of the property destroyed, the calamity is mutual. 3 Kent’s Comm. 467. The Court found what, under all the circumstances, appears to us to have been just and equitable ; and if error would lie in such a case as this, we should not be disposed to disturb the verdict.
The judgment of the Court below is affirmed with costs.
Per Curiam."
"Orloff M. Dorman, vs. Robert Bigelow, Executor of Francis Richard",1 Fla. 281,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Mackae, Justice:
This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the late Superior Court of St. John’s County, in an action of assumpsit brought by Robert Bigelow,' Executor of Francis Richard, deceased, against Or-loffM. Dorman, to recover from the latter, as endorsee, surety, and promisor, the amount of a promissory note alleged to have been executed by one Augustus W. Walker, to the plaintiff, for the hire of a slave, with the following endorsement, alleged to have been made by the defendant:
“ I agree to stand security for the payment of the within amount.
O. M. DORMAN.”
The declaration contains five several counts. The first, charges defendant as endorser of a promissory note: the second, proceeds upon his promise and undertaking in writing, to pay the plaintiff the sum of $205, the amount of said note, when due, in cónsideration that plaintiff would hire a slave to one Augustus W. Walker, for one year r. the third, charges the defendant upon his undertaking in writing, upon a like consideration, to stand security for the payment of said sum for said hire, when due: the fourth, is founded upon alike undertaking, in consideration that plaintiff had hired said slave as aforesaid and the fifth sets out; that defendant in consideration that plaintiff had hired said slave to said Walker, for said sum for one year, upon condition that said Walker should give his promissory note with good security, for the payment thereof made his endorsement in writing on the note so given by said Walker, whereby defendant promised to stand as security for the payment of said sum of money, being the consideration of the hire aforesaid. To this declaration the defendant pleaded the general issue; upon which plea issue was joined, and thereupon verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiff.
No bill of exceptions has been returned, or appears to have been taken and filed in this case, whilst the errors alleged by the counsel for the appellant, appear to be, exclusively based upon the note or instrument filed with the declaration, in the view taken by him of the legal character and effect of the endorsement thereon. Nor has an assignment of errors been regularly made and presented. Those, however, which have, by consent and with the leave of this Court, been informally presented in argument, are of the limited scope just montioned, and they appear to resolve themselves into two leading objections to the judgment below, to which alone we deem it proper to direct the attention of this Court; and in doing this, we do not, as will be shewn in the sequel, consider the determination of these points to be indispensable in making up our opinion and judgment upon the record before us.
The first, and main ground of error relied on is, that under the tenth section of the Statute of Frauds of the State of Florida — Duval's Comp. 206 — the appellant is not liable on account of the endorsement in question, for want of a consideration expressed upon the face of it, whereon to' predicate his alleged undertaking or agreement. In support of this ground, his counsel here assumes the position, that the tenth section referred to, demands the same interpretation as the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds of England — 29 Ch. ii c. 8 — » on the same subject; and for a proper construction of these sections, in view of their application to this case, he cites the leading English and New York cases of Wain vs. Warlters, 5 East. 10, and Sears vs. Brinck, 3 Johns. 210.
The tenth section of the Statute of Frauds of this State, before men. tioned, provides, “ that no action shall be brought whereby to charge any Executor, &c., upon any special promise,” &c., “or whereby to charge the defendant, upon any special promise, to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person, or to charge any person upon any agreement made upon consideration of marriage,” &c.9 “ or upon any contract for the sale of lands,” &c., “ or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year,” &c., “unless the agreement or promise upon which such action shall be brought, or some note or memorandum thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized.” The corresponding section of the English statute referred to, provides, “that no action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, &e., of another person, &c., unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing,” &c. The Statutes of Frauds, of most of the States, including New York, conform ex pressly to that of England. Those of Virginia and Tennessee correspond with the statute of Florida, to the extent above recited. ■
Supposing the case of Wain vs. Warlters at all applicable in the decision of the case at bar, an important preliminary question arises, Whether the decision in that case, is applicable to this, in view of the terms of the 10th section of our statute? — or, in other words, Whether the latter makes it essential to the validity of a written, promise to pay the debt of another, that it should express on its face the consideration on which it is based? In the case .of Colgin vs. Henly — 6 Leigh’s Va. R. 85 — it was the unanimous opinion of the Court, that under the Statute of Frauds of Virginia, the consideration need not be expressed in the written promise, but that it stood as at common law in that regard. This opinion is fully supported by that of the Supreme Court of the United States, pronounced by Ch. J. Marshal, in the case of Violett vs. Patton. 5 Cranch, 142 — 451.
That the tenth section of our Statute of Frauds, in common with that of Virginia, differs in a material point from the 4th section of that of England, is sufficiently clear, not only from the reasoning used in the American cases just cited, but from that employed by several of the learned Judges in the case of Wain vs. Warlters. Upon this difference, indeed, the latter case seems mainly to have turned; for, in its decision, Lawrence, J., says: “ If the question had arisen on the first part of the clause, I conceive that it would only have been necessary that the promise should have been stated in writingbut, he adds, “ the statute going on further to say, that no person shall be charged, &c., unless the agreement, &c., be in writing, shews that the word agreement was meant to be used in a sense different from promise, and something besides the mere promise was required tobe stated.” Le Blanc, J., says: “I should have been as well satisfied, however, if recurring to the words used in the first part of the clause, they had used the same words again in the latter part, and said, unless the promise or agreement, &c., be in writing. But not having so done, I think we must adhere to the strict interpretation of the word agreement, which means the consideration for which, as well as the promise by which the party binds himself.” And it may be fairly inferred, from the language of another of the Judges in that case, that he was of the same opinion. Now, it would appear, that what these Judges desired, or supposed that Parliament might have done, is, what our Legislature has accomplished intentionally. Our statute, certainly, does not mean to give validity to any promise because in writing, which would not have been valid at common law ; and, therefore, would not support one, without sufficient legal consideration, which must be averred, and may be proved at the trial by parol evidence, as heretofore required at the common law. As to the mischief which it was supposed the statute meant to prevent,- it is perhaps sufficient, in view of the ordinary routine of business transactions, that the promise to pay the debt of another should be in writing. It might be safely assumed that, in a very large majority of such cases, the written promise would be found to be sustained by a sufficient legal consideration, which it may be perhaps more proper to leave to parol proof at the trial, than to limit it by a rule, the strictness of which may lead to more fraud in pleading, than it would pre. vent in testimony. But were our statute an exact transcript from the English, or alike subject to the rule of construction laid down in Wain vs. Warlters, it appears that the decision in that case has not met with such universal favor, either in England or the United States, as to make it conclusive authority with this Court, as a precedent, indeed, it seems to have been received in England with considerable surprise and disfavor, as a new construction given to a statute which had been in operation upwards of a century, in support of which no former case was cited, either by counsel or the Judges, at the time it was decided; Lord Eldon has, in the Chancery Court, positively denied its correctness, and in one instance overruled it. In one case he says: “ There is a variety of authorities directly contradicting the case in King’s Bench, which is a most important case in its consequences ; for the undertaking of one man for the debt of another, does not require a consideration moving between them.” • And again, in another case he says: “The first objection, viz., that which Wain vs. Warlters was cited to support, is of great importance. Until that case was decided some time ago, I had always taken the law to be clear, that if a man agreed in writing to pay the debt of another, it was not necessary that the consideration should appear upon the face of the writing.” Ex parte Minet, 14 Vesey, 189 — and exparte Gardom, 15 Vesey, 289.
It is true that the case of Saunders vs. Wakefield, 4 Barn. & Aid. 595, would seem to extend, whilst it recognizes the grounds taken in the case of Wain vs. Warlters; but the case of Jenkins vs. Reynolds, 7 Eng. C. L. R. 328, goes back to the grounds taken in the case of Wain vs. Warlters, referring to the technical import of the word agreement. The case of Egerton vs. Matthews, 6 East. 307, would appear too, to conflict with the leading case of Wain vs. Warlters, although the decision turned upon the 17th sec. of the English Statute of Frauds, in application to that case in which it was determined that a memorandum of a bargain for the sale of goods, signed by the party to be charged, would take the case out of the statute, although the consideration of the bargain was not expressed in the memorandum. A bargain is a contract or agreement between two parties, the one to sell, and the other to buy; and the consideration of a bargain would appear to be as indispensably a part of it, as it is of any other contract or agreement; and there would seem to be as much risk of perjury in proving the consideration of a bargain as of any other agreement, by parol evidence.
In New York, the decision in Wain vs. Warlters, is not only adopted in the case of Sears vs. Brinck, but generally; referring in later decisions to the express terms of the revised statutes, which require that the consideration of an agreement to pay the debt of another, must be expressed. Leonard vs. Vredenburg, 8 John. 29. Smith vs. Ives, 15 Wend. 182. Packer vs. Wilson, 15 Wend. 343. Rogers vs. Kneeland, 10 Wend. 218. But in the case of Leonard vs. Vre-denburg, Ch. J. Kent observed, that, “He had not been altogether satisfied with the decisions therein referred to,” and adds further, “the present motion can be decided without disturbing them.”
In Massachusetts, whose Statute of Frauds is' the same as that of England, the case of Wain vs. Warlters has been entirely overruled, not only in the case of Hunt vs. Adams, 5 Mass. 360, cited by the counsel for the appellee, but in other cases, particularly that of Parc - kard vs. Richardson — 17 Mass. 122 — in which last case, Ch. J. Parker, in pronouncing the opinion of the Court, examines and controverts the English decision in question, with great ability and learning. In that opinion, he says: “ Until 1804, when Wain vs. Warl-ters was decided, there was no case in support of the' doctrine of that case, and that decision excited much surprise, both in England and in this country. Our statute is copied from the English, and has been in operation more than a century, and it never, until lately, has been doubted, that if one man, for a sufficient consideration, deliberately signed his name to a promise to pay the debt of another, it is a sufficient compliance with the statute, without any recital in writing, of the consideration upon which the promise is founded. Although some consideration must exist to give validity to such a promise, it is generally of a nature not to be disputed, and if disputed, has been proved by parol testimony. The consideration is seldom for the benefit of the party making it; forbearance to sue, and the like, being most frequently the consideration of such undertakings; and these being altogether for the benefit of the original debtor. This being the case, it would not enter into the imaginations of the parties to such a contract, that, unless the motives and considerations which led to it were down in writing, the agreement was void,”
In the case of Sage vs. Wilcox — 6 Conn. R. 81 — Ch. J. Hosmer, in delivering the opinion of the Court, comes also to the conclusion, after an able and elaborate review of the English and American cases on the subject, that the consideration of an agreement to answer for the debt of another, is not required by the Statute of Frauds of that State, to be in writing.
Thus, it appears that whatever view be taken of the Statute of Frauds of this State, it. is clear that under the 10th section thereof, a promise to pay the debt of another, made in writing .and signed by the party to be bound, is a sufficient compliance therewith, without any recital in the writing of the consideration upon which the promise is founded, it being competent for the plaintiff, having averred the consideration in such cases, to prove the same by parol testimony on the trial, as at the common law.
But the binding effect of the endorsement in question, does not depend upon the views just taken. On the contrary, it is manifest that the terms of this endorsement, in connection with those of the note or instrument declared on, take it out of the operation of the Statute of Frauds, giving it the most rigid construction that has been placed upon those of England or New York. It is clear that, in this case, the appellant is bound in virtue of this endorsement, the note in question furnishing a sufficient consideration to sustain the promise or agreement so endorsed, and this, whether the endorser be regarded as a joint and several maker of the note absolutely, or as a guarantor, undertaking for the payment thereof. The note and the endorsement being taken as one instrument, the nature of the consideration and promise are therefore sufficiently expressed in writing.' Story on Prom. Notes, s. 58.

The next ground of error presented is, that there is no averment and proof of due diligence on the part of the appellee, in pursuing his debt against the principal in the promissory note. As to this objection, we deem it sufficient to remark, that notice to the payee is necessary in order to release the surety, and’that nothing appears on the record to that effect, or otherwise sustaining the view thus taken. But, as we have intimated, this case presents itself upon the record in an aspect which might well dispense with the determination of the points set up by the plaintiff in error. There be’ing no bill of exceptions, there is nothing to connect the note, upon which the alleged errors are grounded, with the declaration, so as to shew that the former presented the only testimony exhibited before the jury in support of the latter, or that the note was presented in evidence at all. It is merely recited in the declaration as a promissory note. The note, or a copy of it, is required to be filed with, and appended to the declaration by statute, perhaps for the purpose of enabling the.defendant the better to make his defence to the action; and it was in the option of the plaintiff to offer it in evidence or not, as he might deem it expedient; and unless it had been so presented, no notice could have been taken of it, as evidence on the trial below. It is therefore not deemed to be a part of the record submitted for the inspection of this Court, though it might have been made so by a bill of exceptions duly made up in the Court below, as we have hinted. Nor can it be properly brought before us through the, medium of an assignment of errors, however formally made. This is too obvious to require discussion. ,
This case is brought here by writ of error. This latter, or an appeal in the nature of it, is a proceeding in virtue of which a Superior Court examines a record, upon which a judgment was given in another Court inferior to it; and on such examination, to affirm or reverse the same. 6 Wheat. 264. 6 Cond R. 90. Peters’ Digest, 131, s. 19. . And when the alleged error cannot otherwise appear upon the record, a bill of exceptions is necessary to that end. 7 Wheat. 530. 5 Cond. R. 334. Peters’ D. 132, s. 2'l.
In 7 Mass. 448, it is laid down, that a note filed in a cause, as evidence in support of the plaintiff’s action, or to prove his damages upon default, is not part of the record, and the Court cannot take notice of it upon a writ of error, on the ground that illegal evidence was admitted irt support of the action, or in assessment of damages. In further support and illustration of this doctrine, we may also refer to 8 Mass. 383, and 15 Peters, 129. In the latter case the Court held, that the note filed in the cause was not part of the record; that, therefore, that Court could not judicially know when the interest, in regard to which a question of error arose in the case, had commenced running. And it was further remarked, that this ground of error should, for the reason mentioned, have been brought before the Court below, by bill of exceptions setting out the note.
In the case before us, for aught that appears to the contrary, other proof besides the note in question, may have been presented on the trial below, and such as may have influenced or determined the verdict and judgment: and there is nothing to show, that such proof, if so presented, was inadmissible, or otherwise exceptionable in law. In the absence, therefore, of a bill of exceptions, showing the testimony exhibited, the presumption is, that there was full and adequate evidence before the jury, to warrant aiid support the verdict, under the declaration to which it is responsive.
In this view then, the only ground of error of which the appellant can avail himself upon the record and the pleadings, &c., thereby presented, would be, that the declaration of the plaintiff is wholly insufficient to maintain this action. As to this, it is sufficient to remark, that the second, third and fourth counts in the declaration, do not necessarily rest upon the evidence presented by the note filed. They are sufficient in themselves, if sustained by proof, to entitle the plaintiff to a recovery, and there is nothing to show that they were not so sustained before the jury. But it has not been attempted to argue, much less formally to set up as a ground of error, that the declaration is insufficient in any respect to support the verdict and judgment. Nor was any such exception taken to it in the Coürt below, by demurrer or otherwise.
Upon the whole therefore, we are unhesitatingly of the opinion, that there was no error in the judgment of the Court below in this case. It must, consequently, be affirmed with costs."
"State vs. Charles, a Slave",1 Fla. 298,1847-01,Florida Supreme Court,"Douglas, • Chief Justice:
The prisoner in this case, was indicted at the'last October Term of the Circuit Court, holden in and for Hamilton county, under the. 39th section of the act 21st November, 1828, entitled “An Act relating to crimes and misdemeanors committed by slaves, free negroes and mulattoes,” Duval’s Comp. 224, for an assault with an intent to commit a rape on one Zilpha Pennington. The section of the act referred to, declares : “• That if any negro or mulatto shall assault any white woman or child, with intent to commit a rape, such negro or mulatto shall be cropped, branded, or suffer death, at the discretion of the Court.” Zilpha Pennington was a white woman, but the indictment did not so charge. A question was raised-in the Court below, upon the validity of the indictment on that ground; and the Judge who"" held the Court at that Term, entertaining a doubt upon that point, made a statement in writing of the question of law, and brought the same to this Court, pursuant to the provisions of the act of 6th February, 1841, entitled, An Act regulating Appeals and Writs •of Error in criminal cases, by the first section of which it is enacted'., that from and after the passage of this act, no appeal or writ of error, or bill of exceptions to evidence, shall be entertained, allowed or granted to a defendant or defendants in criminal' prosecutions, in any of the Courts of this Territory; but if, in the trial of any criminal prosecution, the Judge before whom the same is tried, shall entertain a doubt upon any legal question arising in the case, then, and in that case, the said Judge, after verdict rendered, may continue the same, and shall, as soon- as convenient, make a statement in writing of the ■question of law, and carry up, or transmit the same to the Court of Appeals, for its consideration and decision.
Upon this state of the case, a question arises, Whether this Court has any jurisdiction of the matter? -The Constitution of this State.. Article 5, section 2, declares, that the Supreme Court, except in cases otherwise directed in this Constitution, shall have appellate jurisdiction only. This is not one of the excepted cases. Is it a- case in which this Court is called upon to exereise appell.ate power ? Here is no final order, judgment, or decree of the Court below, from which an appeal could be taken, or writ of error prosecuted; and the statute expressly provides, that there shall be no such order, judgment, decree, appeal, or writ of error, but when the Judge of the Court, who may be trying such a cause, sha.ll entertain a doubt upon any legal question, authorises him, after verdict and before judgment, to continue the case and send up a statement of the point of law, that it may be decided in the Court above. If the Court were to consider and decide it, the question not having been before decided, the action ■of the Court would be an exercise, rather of original jurisdiction, than of appellate power. Whatever power the late Court of Appeals, in reference to which the act was passed, may have possessed in such cases, this Court, upon mature consideration, is of opinion that it has no jurisdiction of a case thus brought up.
This is a case of highly penal character; and that circumstance, together with the fact, that the law recognizes no other method for bringing up a criminal case, caused the Court to hesitate and weigh the matter well, before it declined to take jurisdiction of it. But, it will be perceived, that, if the Court has jurisdiction of a matter thus brought up, it would be competent for the General Assembly to pro-» vide by law, that, if in the trial of any civil case, the Judge who tries the same, shall entertain a doubt upon any point of law arising in it, either upon the pleadings, reception, or rejection of testimony, instruction given, Or asked and refused to be given to a jury, or any other legal question, such judge, after verdict and before judgment, may continue the same, make a statement of the point of law on' which the doubt arose, and certify it to this Court for its consideration and decision thereon; thus, making this tribunal a Court for the trial of all original questions of law-arising in the Circuit Courts. No one, it is believed, would seriously contend that this Court could take cognizance of such questions so presented. The question of jurisdiction, as was remarked by Judge Baltzell, in pronouncing the opinion of the Court in the case of Stewart and Preston, at the last Term, on the motion to dismiss, is always a delicate one; and the most prudent and safe course for a Court of dernier resort, where any doubt about the power exists, is deemed to be, to decline to act. The exercise of doubtful powers, by a Court of the last resort, is always extremely dangerous, and tends to excite alarm and distrust. If this, therefore, were a doubtful question, that fact would fully justify us in dismissing the proceeding ; but, after having bestowed upon it the most deliberate consideration, we do not deem it such.
Let the case, therefore, be"" dismissed; and the papers transmitted to the Clerk of the Court below.
