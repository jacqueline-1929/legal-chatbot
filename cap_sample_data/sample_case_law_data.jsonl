It is true the recital of the instrument expresses its \u201c purpose to be the securing Carey and the other endorsers from any damage, loss or liability, in consequence of their endprsements,\u201d but the conveyance is made subject to \u201c the conditions and stipulations, that if Preston shall pay all and \u201c each of the notes as they become due, and not make default in any \u201c of them, then the above obligation to be void, and the title thereby \u201c conveyed ; and it was further expressly stipulated, that if Preston \u201c shall fail in payment of said notes and suffer the same to be protes- \u201c ted, or to remain over due in whosoever hands the same he found, \u201c then the said Carey and others, on making affidavit of such non\u201cpayment, and the amount thereof, shall be permitted to foreclose the \u201c mprtgage, take out execution and bring to sale the said negroes, or \u201c any portion necessary to the payment of the sum due, notwilhstand- \u201c ing said sum may not have been' paid or any part thereof, by said \u201c Carey and others.\u201d\nWe are not permitted in the construction of this or any other instrument, to consider one part to the exclusion of another, but must look at the whole to perceive the design of the maker of it. Indemnity was certainly its purpose, but there was an- object beyond this, plainly expressed, by which indeed it was to be accomplished, which was to provide for \u201cpayment of the notes,\u201d and payment in whoso- \u201c ever hands the same might he found.\u201d It is on payment alone of the notes that the \u201c title conveyed and the obligation are to be void,\u201d and extraordinary means are provided to coerce payment even before the endorsers sustain any damage. Now if indemnity had been the sole object, these provisions would have been excluded, and others introduced to the effect that the title and obligation should be void on the endorsers being relieved or released from their responsibility. Such however is not the case.\nIt is then in the opinion of the Court not a mortgage of indemnity to the endorsers merely, but to secure the payment of the not\u00e9is in addition. The decision of this point carries with it the other one taken by defendant\u2019s counsel dependent upon it, that being for indemnity merely, the mortgage was not assignable. As a general rule the endorsement of the notes secured by a mortgage carries with it the mortgage ; this has not been denied in argument, and it has not been deemed necessary to cite authorities in support of it. In the present case there is an endorsement by Carey and others, to the plaintiff \u201c without recourse,\u201d and we proceed to enquire as to its effect upon the transfer of the mortgage.\n\u201c A qualified endorsement in no respect affects the negotiability of \u201c the instrument, but simply qualifies the duties,- obligations and 'res- \u201c ponsibilities of the endorser resulting from the general principles \u201c of law. Thus for example an endorsement of a note to A, without \u2018\u2018recourse will not restrain the negotiability of the note, but willsim- \u201c ply exclude any responsibility of the endorser on the non-accep- \u201c tance or non-payment thereof.\u201d Story on Prom, notes 160, Section 146.\nThe form of such an endorsement best expresses its nature and character: \u201c James Atkins sans recourse or James Atkins with in- \u201c tent only to transfer my interest, and not to be subject to any liability \u201c in case of non-acceptance or non-payment.\u201d Story on Notes, 149 ; Chitty on Bills, 250 \u2014 251.\nWhatever interest then would pass by a general or full endorsement, it seems will pass by a qualified endorsement. If right in this respect, the endorsement in this case carried with it the right and interest of the mortgage, as it certainly did the right to the note itself. This however is not so material, as there is a direct assignment and transfer of the mortgage by Carey and others, the grantees, to the plaintiff. It is alleged that this is invalid on account of the erasure of the words Bank of Columbus, and interlineation of the name of plaintiff, but the law is too well settled to admit of controversy on this point: \u201c An interlineation or erasure apparent on the face of \u201c the deed,\u201d says Chief Justice Marshal, in the case of Speake and others, vs. The United States, \u201c does not of itself avoid it. T.o pro- \u201c duce this effect it must be shown to have been done under circumstances that the law does not warrant.\u201d 9 Cranch, 28 ; 3 Condensed rep. 244.\nIn that case the facts were distinctly put in issue by the plea of non est factum, - whereas in the case under consideration, there is neither averment nor proof that the alteration was illegally or improperly made.\nWe might here close our examination of the case, having disposed of the objections raised by defendant in his pleading, and show a clear and sufficient right in the plaintiff to recover. All other de-fences, according to the rules of pleading, are considered as waived, especially such as are connected with the facts of the' case ; and the rule in this respect is founded upon principles of justice and proprie-' ty. Where .a defence is made in appropriate season, the opposing party may prepare'to meet it, to explain' and remove'whatever may be prejudicial to his case. But when made at an unsuitable time, it may surprise, and if received, do injury and injustice.\n' With these rvemarks, we proceed t\u00f3 notice objections urged in this Court by defendant\u2019s counsel with great zeal, and on which great reliance has been placed, which though not presented by the defence below, it maybe more satisfactory to have cbnsidered. \u201c That the mortgage was made and delivered Upon a ;state of circumstances which afteryards became changed and altered, and to effect purposes afterwards abandoned, and that in truth the.deed was delivered upon conditions not performed. -The notes were endorsed by them without recourse, that endorsement w\u00e1s contemporaneous with the making of the notes in point of law, and thus evinces an entire change of the original design of the parties. In argument it was said, that Carey and others, never were bound, they did not become liable on Preston\u2019s account, they never were sureties at all, they never run any.risk on his account,\u201d 1 \u2019 ,~\nIf all this be true, it was certainly most material to Preston\u2019s de-fence ; it must have been known to him at the time of filing his plea and his failure to rely upon it, if not entirely at variance with its, existence, to say the least, is wholly inexplicable. The position \u201c that Carey and Others, were never sureties, por liable on Preston\u2019s account, nor run any risk for him,\u201d is rather broad, considering' the character of the deed and its provisions, declaring expressly that'they had endorsed for him, and had become his securities.\u201d The other points are based oh the'assumption that \u201cthe endorsement of Carey and,others, was contemporaneous with the making of the notes in point of law,\u201d and that Prestop derived no benefit or advantage from it.\nSuch a presumption would be a very forced one, opposed as it is to the recital \u00f3f the deed, declaring that they had endorsed -in blank, to its objects and'pufposes \u2014 its delivery and possessi\u00f3n by plaintiff, and the direct object and end of Preston in making and procuring them all. The notes are payable at either of the Banks in Columbus, and were obviously designed for discount..' The fact of the endorsement sho.ws that he could not get money, on his own credit, or the discount without endorsers may have been., against the rules of the Bank; hence he procured them \u2014 that he could not get it on endorsement alone ; hence he gave a security on property. Now that Preston, after completing his arrangement and before presenting the notes for discount, should have filled up the endorsement so as to destroy the liability o\u00ed the endorsers, is wholly incredible ; the more so if the effect of the act were to invalidate the mortgage also. He would then, according to the argument of defendant\u2019s counsel, have presented his notes for discount with no security. But if the endorsement was of no use to him nor the mortgage either, why not destroy them and substitute his individual note in their place ? He certainly could not in honesty and fairness have presented a note secured apparently with endorsement and mortgage, for discount, which he knew' at the time to be invalid and worthless. We will not presume a state of facts so injurious to fair dealing and common, honesty. Oh the contrary the fair and rational inference is, that these instruments Were made for an object which was attained, and that they were of use to him. The fair presumption is that the notes were discounted whilst the endorsements were in blank, on the faith of them and the mort. gage, and that the endorsers either took them up by payment or otherwise, and'afterwards transferred\u2019them to the present holder, he taking them with the qualified endorsement; or that the endorsers, the notes having been discounted at Bank, bargained for their exoneration from the endorsement by giving an assignment of the mortgage, an arrangement which they had a right to make, and which Preston could not object to, as by it, his purpose of saving his endorsers through means of a deed made expressly for that object, was fully attained.\nWe have seen, however, that the effect of the qualified endorsement was to transfer the right and interest of the mortgage, so that the effect would be the same, whether the endorsement was filled up contemporaneously with the note or afterwards. If the Bank, or party negotiating the notes, dispensed with the endorsement, so far as to take it without recourse, their design must have been to rely on the mortgage ; and from the fact that it was not discharged, or in any way cancelled, but placed on the record found in possession of plaintiff, the inference is conclusive that Preston regarded it as valid, and a subsisting security. Strong as the above positions are, they are fortified by the fact that credits appear oil the note for monies received by plaintiff of defendant, to nearly half his indebtedness.\nWe fully concur in the position taken by defendant\u2019s counsel, that the mortgage created a trust for the payment of the notes, and that Carey and others might, in a proper case, have been decreed to allow the use of their names, if necessary to a suit, fo have the mortgaged property applied to their payment. This-was\u2019not necessary in this case, as they have assigned their mortgage to plaintiff.\nUpon the whole, we are of opinion that the judgment of the Court below was erroneous and should be reversed. ' It is therefore considered by the Court, that the judgment of the Superior Court be, and the same is hereby reversed and set aside!,'with costs.' And it is further ordered, that this case be remitted to the Circuit Court for the county of-Gadsden, for farther proceedings to be had in conformity to this opinion.\nPer curiam.

The fair presumption is that the notes were discounted whilst the endorsements were in blank, on the faith of them and the mort. gage, and that the endorsers either took them up by payment or otherwise, and'afterwards transferred\u2019them to the present holder, he taking them with the qualified endorsement; or that the endorsers, the notes having been discounted at Bank, bargained for their exoneration from the endorsement by giving an assignment of the mortgage, an arrangement which they had a right to make, and which Preston could not object to, as by it, his purpose of saving his endorsers through means of a deed made expressly for that object, was fully attained.\nWe have seen, however, that the effect of the qualified endorsement was to transfer the right and interest of the mortgage, so that the effect would be the same, whether the endorsement was filled up contemporaneously with the note or afterwards. If the Bank, or party negotiating the notes, dispensed with the endorsement, so far as to take it without recourse, their design must have been to rely on the mortgage ; and from the fact that it was not discharged, or in any way cancelled, but placed on the record found in possession of plaintiff, the inference is conclusive that Preston regarded it as valid, and a subsisting security. Strong as the above positions are, they are fortified by the fact that credits appear oil the note for monies received by plaintiff of defendant, to nearly half his indebtedness.\nWe fully concur in the position taken by defendant\u2019s counsel, that the mortgage created a trust for the payment of the notes, and that Carey and others might, in a proper case, have been decreed to allow the use of their names, if necessary to a suit, fo have the mortgaged property applied to their payment. This-was\u2019not necessary in this case, as they have assigned their mortgage to plaintiff.\nUpon the whole, we are of opinion that the judgment of the Court below was erroneous and should be reversed. ' It is therefore considered by the Court, that the judgment of the Superior Court be, and the same is hereby reversed and set aside!,'with costs.' And it is further ordered, that this case be remitted to the Circuit Court for the county of-Gadsden, for farther proceedings to be had in conformity to this opinion.\nPer curiam. ' Judgment reversed."}]}
